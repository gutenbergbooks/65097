  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>In concluding the first volume of this Journal,
the editor wishes to say a few things regarding
its contents, even at the risk of repeating,
in some cases, what has already been
said. He hopes that his judgment in the
selection of articles will be, in the main, approved.
In so novel an undertaking it is not
to be expected that the proper elevation and
range will be found at once. But the editor
thinks that he has acquired some valuable experience
that will aid him in preparing the
second volume.</p>

<p class='c006'>The reader will notice, upon looking over
the table of contents, that about one-third of
the articles relate to Art, and hence recommend
themselves more especially to those who
seek artistic culture, and wish at the same
time to have clear conceptions regarding it.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is, perhaps, a mistake to select so little
that bears on physical science, which is by far
the most prominent topic of interest at the
present day. In order to provide for this, the
editor hopes to print in the next volume detailed
criticisms of the “Positive Philosophy,”
appreciating its advantages and defects of
method and system. The “Development
Theory,” the “Correlation of Physical, Vital
and Mental Forces,” the abstract theories in
our text-books on Natural Philosophy, regarding
the nature of attraction, centrifugal and
centripetal forces, light, heat, electricity, chemical
elements, &amp;c., demand the investigation
of the speculative thinker. The exposition of
Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit will furnish
pertinent thoughts relating to method.</p>

<p class='c006'>While the large selection of translations
has met with approval from very high sources,
yet there has been some disappointment expressed
at the lack of original articles. Considerably
more than half of the articles have
been original entirely, while all the translations
are new. The complaint, however, relates
more especially to what its authors are pleased
to call the Un-American character of the contents
of the Journal. Here the editor feels
like pleading ignorance as an excuse.—In
what books is one to find the true “American”
type of Speculative Philosophy? Certain very
honorable exceptions occur to every one, but
they are not American in a popular sense.
We, as a people, buy immense editions of
John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, Comte,
Hamilton, Cousin, and others; one can trace the
appropriation and digestion of their thoughts
in all the leading articles of our Reviews, Magazines
and books of a thoughtful character.
If this is American philosophy, the editor
thinks that it may be very much elevated by
absorbing and digesting more refined aliment.
It is said that of Herbert Spencer’s works
nearly twenty thousand have been sold in this
country, while in England scarcely the first
edition has been bought. This is encouraging
for the American thinker: what lofty spiritual
culture may not become broadly and firmly
rooted here where thoughtful minds are so
numerous? Let this spirit of inquiry once
extend to thinkers like Plato and Aristotle,
Schelling and Hegel—let these be digested and
organically reproduced—and what a phalanx
of American thinkers we may have to boast
of! For after all it is not “American <i>thought</i>”
so much as American <i>thinkers</i> that we want.
To <i>think</i>, in the highest sense, is to transcend
all <i>natural limits</i>—such, for example, as national
peculiarities, defects in culture, distinctions
in Race, habits, and modes of living—to
be <i>universal</i>, so that one can dissolve away the
external hull and seize the substance itself.
The peculiarities stand in the way;—were it
not for these, we should find in Greek or German
Philosophy just the forms we ourselves
need. Our province as <i>Americans</i> is to rise to
purer forms than have hitherto been attained,
and thus speak a “solvent word” of more potency
than those already uttered. If this be
the goal we aim at, it is evident that we can
find no other means so well adapted to rid us
of our own idiosyncracies as the study of the
greatest thinkers of all ages and all times.
May this Journal aid such a consummation!</p>

<p class='c006'>In conclusion, the editor would heartily
thank all who have assisted him in this enterprise,
by money and cheering words; he
hopes that they will not withdraw in the future
their indispensable aid. To others he
owes much for kind assistance rendered in
preparing articles for the printer. Justice
demands that special acknowledgment should
be made here of the services of Miss Anna C.
Brackett, whose skill in proof-reading, and
subtle appreciation of philosophic thought have
rendered her editorial assistance invaluable.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY. <br /> Vol. I. 1867. No. 1.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c001'>TO THE READER.</h3>
<p class='c005'>For the reason that a journal devoted
exclusively to the interests of Speculative
Philosophy is a rare phenomenon in the
English language, some words may reasonably
be expected from the Editors upon
the scope and design of the present undertaking.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no need, it is presumed, to
speak of the immense religious movements
now going on in this country and in England.
The tendency to break with the
traditional, and to accept only what bears
for the soul its own justification, is widely
active, and can end only in the demand
that Reason shall find and establish a philosophical
basis for all those great ideas
which are taught as religious dogmas. Thus
it is that side by side with the naturalism of
such men as Renan, a school of mystics is
beginning to spring up who prefer to ignore
utterly all historical wrappages, and cleave
only to the speculative kernel itself. The
vortex between the traditional faith and the
intellectual conviction cannot be closed by
renouncing the latter, but only by deepening
it to speculative insight.</p>

<p class='c006'>Likewise it will be acknowledged that
the national consciousness has moved forward
on to a new platform during the last
few years. The idea underlying our form
of government had hitherto developed
only one of its essential phases—that of
brittle individualism—in which national
unity seemed an external mechanism,
soon to be entirely dispensed with, and
the enterprise of the private man or of the
corporation substituted for it. Now we
have arrived at the consciousness of the
other essential phase, and each individual
recognizes his substantial side to be the
State as such. The freedom of the citizen
does not consist in the mere Arbitrary, but
in the realization of the rational conviction
which finds expression in established
law. That this new phase of national life
demands to be digested and comprehended,
is a further occasion for the cultivation of
the Speculative.</p>

<p class='c006'>More significant still is the scientific
revolution, working out especially in the
domain of physics. The day of simple
empiricism is past, and with the doctrine
of “Correlation of forces” there has arisen
a stage of reflection that deepens rapidly
into the purely speculative. For the further
elucidation of this important point the
two following articles have been prepared.
It is hoped that the first one will answer
more definitely the question now arising in
the mind of the reader, “What is this
Speculative Knowing of which you speak?”
and that the second one will show whither
Natural Science is fast hastening.</p>

<p class='c006'>With regard to the pretensions of this
Journal, its editors know well how much
its literary conduct will deserve censure
and need apology. They hope that the
substance will make up in some degree for
deficiencies in form; and, moreover, they
expect to improve in this respect through
experience and the kind criticisms of
friends.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>THE SPECULATIVE.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c009'>“We need what Genius is unconsciously seeking, and, by some daring generalization of the
universe, shall assuredly discover, a spiritual calculus, a <i>Novum Organon</i>, whereby nature shall
be divined in the soul, the soul in God, matter in spirit, polarity resolved into unity; and that
power which pulsates in all life, animates and builds all organizations, shall manifest itself as
one universal deific energy, present alike at the outskirts and centre of the universe, whose
centre and circumference are one; omniscient, omnipotent, self-subsisting, uncontained, yet
containing all things in the unbroken synthesis of its being.”—(“<span class='sc'>Calculus</span>,” <i>one of Alcott’s
“Orphic Sayings.”</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'>At the end of the sixth book of Plato’s
Republic, after a characterization of the
two grades of sensuous knowing and the
grade of the understanding, “which is
obliged to set out from hypotheses, for the
reason that it does not deal with principles
but only with results,” we find the speculative
grade of knowing characterized as
“that in which the soul, setting out from
an hypothesis, proceeds to an unhypothetical
principle, and makes its way without
the aid of [sensuous] images, but solely
through ideas themselves.” The mathematical
procedure which begins by hypothecating
definitions, axioms, postulates,
and the like, which it never examines nor
attempts to deduce or prove, is the example
given by Plato of the method of the Understanding,
while he makes the speculative
Reason “to posit hypotheses by the
Dialectic, <i>not as fixed principles</i>, but only
as starting points, in order that, by removing
them, it may arrive at the unhypothetical—the
principle of the universe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This most admirable description is fully
endorsed by Aristotle, and firmly established
in a two-fold manner:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In the Metaphysics (xi. 7) he shows
ontologically, starting with <i>motion</i> as an
hypothesis, that the <i>self-moved</i> is the first
principle; and this he identifies with the
speculative, and the being of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. In the <i>De Anima</i> (iii. 5-8) he distinguishes
psychologically the “active intellect”
as the highest form of knowing,
as that which is its own object, (subject
and object,) and hence as containing its
own end and aim in itself—as being infinite.
He identifies this with the Speculative
result, which he found ontologically
as the Absolute.</p>

<p class='c006'>Spinoza in his Ethics (Prop. xl. Schol.
ii., and Prop, xliv., Cor. ii. of Part II.)
has well described the Speculative, which
he names “<i>Scientia intuitiva</i>,” as the
thinking of things under the form of eternity,
(<i>De natura rationis est res sub quadam
specie æternitatis percipere.</i>)</p>

<p class='c006'>Though great diversity is found in respect
to form and systematic exposition
among the great philosophers, yet there is
the most complete unanimity, not only
with respect to the transcendency of the
Speculative, but also with reference to the
content of its knowing. If the reader of
different systems of Philosophy has in
himself achieved some degree of Speculative
culture, he will at every step be delighted
and confirmed at the agreement of
what, to the ordinary reader, seem irreconcilable
statements.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not only do speculative writers agree
among themselves as to the nature of
things, and the destiny of man and the
world, but their results furnish us in the
form of pure thought what the artist has
wrought out in the form of beauty.
Whether one tests architecture, sculpture,
painting, music or poetry, it is all the
same. Goethe has said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As all Nature’s thousand changes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But one changeless God proclaim;</div>
      <div class='line'>So in Art’s wide kingdoms ranges</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One sole meaning, still the same:</div>
      <div class='line'>This is Truth, eternal Reason,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which from Beauty takes its dress,</div>
      <div class='line'>And serene, through time and season,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Stands for aye in loveliness.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>While Art presents this content to the
senses, Religion offers it to the conception
in the form of a dogma to be held by faith;
the deepest Speculative truth is allegorically
typified in a historical form, so that
it acts upon the mind partly through fantasy
and partly through the understanding.
Thus Religion presents the same
content as Art and Philosophy, but stands
between them, and forms a kind of middle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>ground upon which the purification takes
place. “It is the purgatory between the
Inferno of Sense and the Paradise of Reason.”
Its function is mediation; a continual
degrading of the sensuous and external,
and an elevation to the supersensual
and internal. The transition of Religion
into Speculative Philosophy is found in
the mystics. Filled with the profound
significance of religious symbolism, and
seeing in it the explanation of the universe,
they essay to communicate their insights.
But the form of Science is not
yet attained by them. They express
themselves, not in those universal categories
that the Spirit of the Race has formed
in language for its utterance, but they
have recourse to symbols more or less inadequate
because ambiguous, and of insufficient
universality to stand for the archetypes
themselves. Thus “Becoming” is
the most pure germinal archetype, and belongs
therefore to logic, or the system of
pure thought, and it has correspondences
on concrete planes, as e.g., <i>time</i>, <i>motion</i>,
<i>life</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> Now if one of these concrete
terms is used for the pure logical category,
we have mysticism. The alchemists, as
shown by a genial writer of our day, use
the technique of their craft to express the
profound mysteries of spirit and its regeneration.
The Eleusinian and other mysteries
do the like.</p>

<p class='c006'>While it is one of the most inspiring
things connected with Speculative Philosophy
to discover that the “Open Secret
of the Universe” has been read by so
many, and to see, under various expressions,
the same meaning; yet it is the
highest problem of Speculative Philosophy
to seize a method that is adequate to
the expression of the “Secret;” for its
(the content’s) own method of genetic development
must be the only adequate one.
Hence it is that we can classify philosophic
systems by their success in seizing the
content which is common to Art and Religion,
as well as to Philosophy, in such a
manner as to allow its free evolution; to
have as little in the method that is merely
formal, or extraneous to the idea itself.
The rigid formalism of Spinoza—though
manipulated by a dear speculative spirit—is
inadequate to the unfolding of its content;
for how could the mathematical
method, which is that of quantity or external
determinations alone, ever suffice to
unfold those first principles which attain
to the quantitative only in their result?</p>

<p class='c006'>In this, the profoundest of subjects, we
always find in Plato light for the way. Although
he has not given us complete examples,
yet he has pointed out the road of
the true Speculative method in a way not
to be mistaken. Instead of setting out
with first principles presupposed as true,
by which all is to be established, (as mathematics
and such sciences do), he asserts
that the first starting points must be removed
as inadequate. We begin with the
immediate, which is utterly insufficient,
and exhibits itself as such. We ascend to
a more adequate, by removing the first
hypothesis; and this process repeats itself
until we come to the first principle, which
of course bears its own evidence in this,
that it is absolutely universal and absolutely
determined at the same time; in
other words it is the self-determining, the
“self-moved,” as Plato and Aristotle call
it. It is its own other, and hence it is the
true infinite, for it is not limited but continued
by its other.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this peculiarity results the difficulty
of Speculative Philosophy. The unused
mind, accepting with naïveté the first proposition
as settled, finds itself brought
into confusion when this is contradicted,
and condemns the whole procedure. The
irony of Socrates, that always begins by
positing the ground of his adversary, and
reducing it through its own inadequateness
to contradict itself, is of this character,
and the unsophisticated might say, and do
say: “See how illogical is Socrates, for
he sets out to establish something, and arrives
rather at the destruction of it.” The
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i> is a faint imitation
of the same method. It is not sufficient
to prove your own system by itself,
for each of the opposing systems can do
that; but you must show that any and all
counter-hypotheses result in your own.
God makes the wrath of men to praise
Him, and all imperfect things must continually
demonstrate the perfect, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>reason that they do not exist by reason of
their defects, but through what of truth
there is in them, and the imperfection is
continually manifesting the <i>want</i> of the
perfect. “Spirit,” says Hegel, “is self-contained
being. But matter, which is
spirit outside of itself, [turned inside out,]
continually manifests this, its inadequacy,
through gravity—attraction to a central
point beyond each particle. (If it could
get at this central point, it would have no
extension, and hence would be annihilated.)”</p>

<p class='c006'>The soul of this method lies in the comprehension
of the negative. In that wonderful
exposé of the importance of the
negative, which Plato gives in the Parmenides
and Sophist, we see how justly
he appreciated its true place in Philosophic
Method. Spinoza’s “<i>omnis determinatio
est negatio</i>” is the most famous
of modern statements respecting the negative,
and has been very fruitful in results.</p>

<p class='c006'>One would greatly misunderstand the
Speculative view of the negative should
he take it to mean, as some have done,
“that the negative is as essential as the
positive.” For if they are two independent
somewhats over against each other,
having equal validity, then all unity of
system is absolutely impossible—we can
have only the Persian Ahriman and Ormuzd;
nay, not even these—for unless
there is a primal unity, a “<i>Zeruane-Akerene</i>”—the
uncreated one, these are impossible
as opposites, for there can be no
tension from which the strife should proceed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Speculative has insight into the
constitution of the positive out of the
negative. “That which has the form of
Being,” says Hegel, “is the self-related;”
but relation of all kinds is negation, and
hence whatever has the form of being and
is a positive somewhat, is a self-related
negative. Those three stages of culture in
knowing, talked of by Plato and Spinoza,
may be characterized in a new way by
their relation to this concept.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first stage of consciousness—that of
immediate or sensuous knowing—seizes
objects by themselves—isolatedly—without
their relations; each seems to have validity
in and for itself, and to be wholly positive
and real. The negative is the mere
absence of the real thing; and it utterly
ignores it in its scientific activity.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the second stage traces relations,
and finds that things do not exist in immediate
independence, but that each is related
to others, and it comes to say that
“Were a grain of sand to be destroyed,
the universe would collapse.” It is a
necessary consequent to the previous stage,
for the reason that so soon as the first
stage gets over its childish engrossment
with the novelty of variety, and attempts
to seize the individual thing, it finds its
characteristic marks or properties. But
these consist invariably of relations to
other things, and it learns that these properties,
without which the thing could
have no distinct existence, are the very
destruction of its independence, since
they are its complications with other
things.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this stage the negative has entered
and has full sway. For all that was before
firm and fixed, is now seen to be, not
through itself, but through others, and
hence the being of everything is its negation.
For if this stone exists only through
its relations to the sun, which is <i>not</i> the
stone but something else, then the being
of this stone is its own negation. But the
second stage only reduces all to dependence
and finitude, and does not show us
how any real, true, or independent being
can be found to exist. It holds fast to the
stage of mediation alone, just as the first
stage held by the <i>immediate</i>. But the
dialectic of this position forces it over
into the third.</p>

<p class='c006'>If things exist only in their relations,
and relations are the negatives of things,
then all that appears positive—all being—must
rest upon negation. How is this?
The negative is essentially a relative, but
since it as the only substrate (for all is
relative), it can relate only to itself. But
self-relation is always identity, and here
we have the solution of the previous difficulty.
All positive forms, all forms of immediateness
or being, all forms of identity,
are self-relations, consisting of a negative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>or relative, relating to itself. But the
most wonderful side of this, is the fact that
since this relation is that of the <i>negative</i>,
it <i>negates</i> itself in its very relation, and
hence its <i>identity</i> is a producing of <i>non</i>-identity.
Identity and distinction are
produced by the self-same process, and
thus <i>self-determination</i> is the origin of all
identity and distinction likewise. This
is the speculative stand-point in its completeness.
It not only possesses speculative
content, but is able to evolve a speculative
system likewise. It is not only
conscious of the principles, but of their
method, and thus all is transparent.</p>

<p class='c006'>To suppose that this may be made so
plain that one shall see it at first sight,
would be the height of absurdity. Doubtless
far clearer expositions can be made
of this than those found in Plato or
Proclus, or even in Fichte and Hegel; but
any and every exposition must incur the
same difficulty, viz: The one who masters
it must undergo a thorough change in his
innermost. The “Palingenesia” of the
intellect is as essential as the “regeneration
of the heart,” and is at bottom the
same thing, as the mystics teach us.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this great difference is obvious superficially:
In religious regeneration it
seems the yielding up of the self to an
alien, though beneficent, power, while in
philosophy it seems the complete identification
of one’s self with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>He, then, who would ascend into the
thought of the best thinkers the world has
seen, must spare no pains to elevate his
thinking to the plane of pure thought.
The completest discipline for this may be
found in Hegel’s Logic. Let one not despair,
though he seem to be baffled seventy
and seven times; his earnest and vigorous
assault is repaid by surprisingly increased
strength of mental acumen which he will
be assured of, if he tries his powers on
lower planes after his attack has failed on
the highest thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>These desultory remarks on the Speculative,
may be closed with a few illustrations
of what has been said of the negative.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Everything must have limits that
mark it off from other things, and these
limits are its negations, in which it ceases.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. It must likewise have qualities which
distinguish it from others, but these
likewise are negatives in the sense that
they exclude it from them. Its determining
by means of qualities is the making
it <i>not</i> this and <i>not</i> that, but exactly what
it is. Thus the affirmation of anything is
at the same time the negation of others.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. Not only is the negative manifest
in the above general and abstract form,
but its penetration is more specific. Everything
has distinctions from others in
general, but also from <i>its</i> other. <i>Sweet</i> is
opposed not only to other properties in
general, as <i>white</i>, <i>round</i>, <i>soft</i>, etc., but
to <i>its</i> other, or <i>sour</i>. So, too, white is
opposed to black, soft to hard, heat to
cold, etc., and in general a <i>positive</i> thing
to a <i>negative</i> thing. In this kind of relative,
the negative is more essential, for it
seems to constitute the intimate nature of
the opposites, so that each is reflected in
the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. More remarkable are the appearances
of the negative in nature. The element
<i>fire</i> is a negative which destroys the
form of the combustible. It reduces organic
substances to inorganic elements,
and is that which negates the organic.
Air is another negative element. It acts
upon all terrestrial elements; upon water,
converting it into invisible vapor; upon
metals, reducing them to earths through
corrosion—eating up iron to form rust,
rotting wood into mould—destructive
or negative alike to the mineral
and vegetable world, like fire, to which
it has a speculative affinity. The grand
type of all negatives in nature, such as
air and fire, is <i>Time</i>, the great devourer,
and archetype of all changes and
movements in nature. Attraction is
another appearance of the negative. It
is a manifestation in some body of an essential
connection with another which is
not it; or rather it is an embodied self-contradiction:
“that other (the sun)
which is not me (the earth) is my true
being.” Of course its own being is its
own negation, then.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, too, the plant is negative to the
inorganic—it assimilates it; the animal is
negative to the vegetable world.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>As we approach these higher forms of
negation, we see the negative acting
against itself, and this constitutes a process.
The food that life requires, which
it negates in the process of digestion, and
assimilates, is, in the life process, again
negated, eliminated from the organism,
and replaced by new elements. A negation
is made, and this is again negated.
But the higher form of negation appears
in the generic; “The species lives and the
individual dies.” The generic continually
transcends the individual—going forth to
new individuals and deserting the old—a
process of birth and decay, both negative
processes. In conscious Spirit both
are united in one-movement. The generic
here enters the individual as pure <i>ego</i>—the
undetermined possibility of all determinations.
Since it is undetermined,
it is negative to all special determinations.
But this <i>ego</i> not only exists as
subject, but also as object—a process of
self-determination or self-negation. And
this negation or particularization continually
proceeds from one object to another,
and remains conscious under the whole,
not dying, as the mere animal does, in the
transition from individual to individual.
This is the <i>aperçu</i> of Immortality.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>HERBERT SPENCER.</h3>
<h4 class='c012'>CHAPTER I. <br /> THE CRISIS IN NATURAL SCIENCE.</h4>
<p class='c005'>During the past twenty years a revolution
has been working in physical science.
Within the last ten it has come to the surface,
and is now rapidly spreading into
all departments of mental activity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although its centre is to be found in the
doctrine of the “Correlation of Forces,” it
would be a narrow view that counted only
the expounders of this doctrine, numerous
as they are; the spirit of this movement
inspires a heterogeneous multitude—Carpenter,
Grove, Mayer, Faraday, Thompson,
Tyndall and Helmholtz; Herbert Spencer,
Stuart Mill, Buckle, Draper, Lewes, Lecky,
Max Müller, Marsh, Liebig, Darwin and
Agassiz; these names, selected at random,
are suggested on account of the extensive
circulation of their books. Every day the
press announces some new name in this
field of research.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is the character of the old which
is displaced, and of the new which gets
established?</p>

<p class='c006'>By way of preliminary, it must be remarked
that there are observable in modern
times three general phases of culture,
more or less historic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first phase is thoroughly dogmatic:
it accepts as of like validity metaphysical
abstractions, and empirical observations.
It has not arrived at such a degree of
clearness as to perceive contradictions between
form and content. For the most
part, it is characterized by a reverence for
external authority. With the revival of
learning commences the protest of spirit
against this phase. Descartes and Lord
Bacon begin the contest, and are followed
by the many—Locke, Newton, Leibnitz,
Clark, and the rest. All are animated with
the spirit of that time—to come to the
matter in hand without so much mediation.
Thought wishes to rid itself of its fetters;
religious sentiment, to get rid of forms.
This reaction against the former stage,
which has been called by Hegel the metaphysical,
finds a kind of climax in the intellectual
movement just preceding the
French revolution. Thought no longer is
contented to say “Cogito, ergo sum,” abstractly,
but applies the doctrine in all directions,
“I think; in that deed, I am.”
“I am a man only in so far as I think. In
so far as I think, I am an essence. What I
get from others is not mine. What I can
comprehend, or dissolve in my reason, that
is mine.” It looks around and spies institutions—“clothes
of spirit,” as Herr Teufelsdroeck
calls them. “What are you
doing here, you sniveling priest?” says
Voltaire: “you are imposing delusions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>upon society for your own aggrandizement.
<i>I</i> had no part or lot in making the church;
<i>cogito, ergo sum</i>; I will only have over me
what I put there!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I see that all these complications of
society are artificial,” adds Rousseau;
“man has made them; they are not good,
and let us tear them down and make
anew.” These utterances echo all over
France and Europe. “The state is merely
a machine by which the few exploiter the
many”—“off with crowns!” Thereupon
they snatch off the crown of poor Louis,
and his head follows with it. “Reason”
is enthroned and dethroned. Thirty years
of war satiates at length this negative second
period, and the third phase begins.
Its characteristic is to be constructive, not
to accept the heritage of the past with passivity,
nor wantonly to destroy, but to
realize itself in the world of objectivity—the
world of laws and institutions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first appearance of the second phase
of consciousness is characterized by the
grossest inconsistencies. It says in general,
(see D’Holbach’s “Système de la Nature”):
“The immediate, only, is true;
what we know by our senses, alone has
reality; all is matter and force.” But in
this utterance it is unconscious that matter
and force are purely general concepts, and
not objects of immediate consciousness.
What we see and feel is not matter or
force in general, but only some special
form. The self-refutation of this phase
may be exhibited as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. “What is known is known through
the senses: it is matter and force.”</p>

<p class='c006'>II. But by the senses, the particular only
is perceived, and this can never be <i>matter</i>,
but merely a <i>form</i>. The general is a mediated
result, and not an object of the senses.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. Hence, in positing matter and force
as the content of sensuous knowing, they
unwittingly assert mediation to be the
content of immediateness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The decline of this period of science results
from the perception of the contradiction
involved. Kant was the first to show
this; his labors in this field may be
summed up thus:</p>

<p class='c006'>The universal and necessary is not an
empirical result. (General laws cannot be
sensuously perceived.) The constitution
of the mind itself, furnishes the ground for
it:—first, we have an <i>a priori</i> basis (time
and space) necessarily presupposed as the
condition of all sensuous perception; and
then we have categories presupposed as the
basis of every generalization whatever.
Utter any general proposition: for example
the one above quoted—“all is matter and
force”—and you merely posit two categories—Inherence
and Causality—as objectively
valid. In all universal and necessary
propositions we announce only the
subjective conditions of experience, and
not anything in and for itself true (i. e.
applicable to things in themselves).</p>

<p class='c006'>At once the popular side of this doctrine
began to take effect. “We know only phenomena;
the true object in itself we do
not know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This doctrine of phenomenal knowing
was outgrown in Germany at the commencement
of the present century. In
1791—ten years after the publication of
the Critique of Pure Reason—the deep
spirit of Fichte began to generalize Kant’s
labors, and soon he announced the legitimate
results of the doctrine. Schelling
and Hegel completed the work of transforming
what Kant had left in a negative
state, into an affirmative system of truth.
The following is an outline of the refutation
of Kantian scepticism:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Kant reduces all objective knowledge
to phenomenal: we furnish the form of
knowing, and hence whatever we announce
in general concerning it—and all that we
call science has, of course, the form of
generality—is merely our subjective forms,
and does not belong to the thing in itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. This granted, say the later philosophers,
it follows that the subjective swallows
up all and becomes itself the universal
(subject and object of itself), and
hence Reason is the true substance of the
universe. Spinoza’s <i>substance</i> is thus seen
to become <i>subject</i>. We partake of God as
intellectually seeing, and we see only God
as object, which Malebranche and Berkeley
held with other Platonists.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The categories (e. g. Unity, Reality,
Causality, Existence, etc.) being merely
subjective, or given by the constitution of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the mind itself—for such universals are
presupposed by all experience, and hence
not derived from it—it follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If we abstract what we know to be
subjective, that we abstract all possibility
of a thing in itself, too. For “existence”
is a category, and hence if subjective, we
may reasonably conclude that nothing objective
can have existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Hence, since one category has no preference
over another, and we cannot give
one of them objectivity without granting it
to all others, it follows that there can be
no talk of <i>noumena</i>, or of things in themselves,
<i>existing</i> beyond the reach of the
mind, for such talk merely applies what it
pronounces to be subjective categories,
(existence) while at the same time it denies
the validity of their application.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. But since we remove the supposed
“<i>noumena</i>,” the so-called phenomena are
not opposed any longer to a correlate beyond
the intelligence, and the <i>noumenon</i>
proves to be <i>mind itself</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>An obvious corollary from this is, that by
the self-determination of mind in pure
thinking we shall find the fundamental
laws of all phenomena.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though the Kantian doctrine soon gave
place in Germany to deeper insights, it
found its way slowly to other countries.
Comte and Sir Wm. Hamilton have made
the negative results very widely known—the
former, in natural science; the latter,
in literature and philosophy. Most of the
writers named at the beginning are more or
less imbued with Comte’s doctrines, while
a few follow Hamilton. For rhetorical
purposes, the Hamiltonian statement is far
superior to all others; for practical purposes,
the Comtian. The physicist wishing
to give his undivided attention to empirical
observation, desires an excuse for neglecting
pure thinking; he therefore refers
to the well-known result of philosophy,
that we cannot know anything of ultimate
causes—we are limited to phenomena and
laws. Although it must be conceded that
this consolation is somewhat similar to
that of the ostrich, who cunningly conceals
his head in the sand when annoyed
by the hunters, yet great benefit has
thereby accrued to science through the
undivided zeal of the investigators thus
consoled.</p>

<p class='c006'>When, however, a sufficiently large collection
has been made, and the laws are
sought for in the chaotic mass of observations,
then <i>thought</i> must be had. Thought
is the only crucible capable of dissolving
“the many into the one.” Tycho Brahe
served a good purpose in collecting observations,
but a Kepler was required to discern
the celestial harmony involved therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>This discovery of laws and relations, or
of relative unities, proceeds to the final
stage of science, which is that of the <i>absolute
comprehension</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus modern science, commencing with
the close of the metaphysical epoch, has
three stages or phases:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. The first rests on mere isolated facts
of experience; accepts the first phase of
things, or that which comes directly before
it, and hence may be termed the stage of
<i>immediateness</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The second relates its thoughts to
one another and compares them; it developes
inequalities; tests one through another,
and discovers dependencies everywhere;
since it learns that the first phase
of objects is phenomenal, and depends upon
somewhat lying beyond it; since it denies
truth to the immediate, it may be
termed the stage of <i>mediation</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. A final stage which considers a phenomenon
in its totality, and thus seizes it
in its <i>noumenon</i>, and is the stage of the
<i>comprehension</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>To resume: the <i>first</i> is that of sensuous
knowing; the <i>second</i>, that of reflection (the
understanding); the <i>third</i>, that of the reason
(or the speculative stage).</p>

<p class='c006'>In the sensuous knowing, we have crude,
undigested masses all co-ordinated; each
is in and for itself, and perfectly valid
without the others. But as soon as reflection
enters, dissolution is at work.
Each is thought in sharp contrast with the
rest; contradictions arise on every hand.
The third stage finds its way out of these
quarrelsome abstractions, and arrives at a
synthetic unity, at a system, wherein the
antagonisms are seen to form an organism.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first stage of the development closes
with attempts on all hands to put the results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>in an encyclopædiacal form. Humboldt’s
Cosmos is a good example of this
tendency, manifested so widely. Matter,
masses, and <i>functions</i> are the subjects of
investigation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reflection investigates <i>functions</i> and
seizes the abstract category of force, and
straightway we are in the second stage.
Matter, as such, loses its interest, and “correlation
of forces” absorbs all attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>Force is an arrogant category and will
not be co-ordinated with matter; if admitted,
we are led to a pure dynamism.
This will become evident as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Force implies confinement (to give it
direction); it demands, likewise, an “occasion,”
or soliciting force to call it into
activity.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. But it cannot be confined except by
force; its occasion must be a force likewise.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. Thus, since its confinement and “occasion”
are forces, force can only act upon
forces—upon matter only in so far as that
is a force. Its nature requires confinement
in order to manifest it, and hence it cannot
act or exist except in unity with other
forces which likewise have the same dependence
upon it that it has upon them.
<i>Hence a force has no independent subsistence,
but is only an element of a combination
of opposed forces</i>, which combination is a
unity existing in an opposed manner (or
composed of forces in a state of tension).
This deeper unity which we come upon as
the ground of force is properly named <i>law</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this, two corollaries are to be
drawn: (1.) That matter is merely a name
for various forces, as resistance, attraction
and repulsion, etc. (2.) That force is no
ultimate category, but, upon reflection, is
seen to rest upon law as a deeper category
(not law as a mere similarity of phenomena,
but as a true unity underlying
phenomenal multiplicity).</p>

<p class='c006'>From the nature of the category of force
we see that whoever adopts it as the ultimate,
embarks on an ocean of dualism, and
instead of “seeing everywhere the one and
all” as did Xenophanes, he will see everywhere
the self opposed, the contradictory.</p>

<p class='c006'>The crisis which science has now reached
is of this nature. The second stage is at
its commencement with the great bulk of
scientific men.</p>

<p class='c006'>To illustrate the self-nugatory character
ascribed to this stage we shall adduce
some of the most prominent positions of
Herbert Spencer, whom we regard as the
ablest exponent of this movement. These
contradictions are not to be deprecated, as
though they indicated a decline of thought;
on the contrary, they show an increased activity,
(though in the stage of mere reflection,)
and give us good omens for the future.
The era of stupid mechanical thinkers is
over, and we have entered upon the active,
<i>chemical</i> stage of thought, wherein the
thinker is trained to consciousness concerning
his abstract categories, which, as
Hegel says, “drive him around in their
whirling circle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that the body of scientific men are
turned in this direction, we behold a vast
upheaval towards philosophic thought; and
this is entirely unlike the isolated phenomenon
(hitherto observed in history) of a
single group of men lifted above the surrounding
darkness of their age into clearness.
We do not have such a phenomenon
in our time; it is the spirit of the nineteenth
century to move by masses.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CHAPTER II. <br /> THE “FIRST PRINCIPLES” OF THE “UNKNOWABLE.”</h4>
<p class='c005'>The <i>British Quarterly</i> speaking of Spencer,
says: “These ‘First Principles’ are
merely the foundation of a system of Philosophy,
bolder, more elaborate and comprehensive,
perhaps, than any other which
has been hitherto designed in England.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The persistence and sincerity, so generally
prevailing among these correlationists,
we have occasion to admire in Herbert
Spencer. He seems to be always ready to
sacrifice his individual interest for truth,
and is bold and fearless in uttering, what
he believes it to be.</p>

<p class='c006'>For critical consideration no better division
can be found than that adopted in the
“First Principles” by Mr. Spencer himself,
to wit: 1st, the unknowable, 2nd, the knowable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Accordingly, let us examine first his
theory of</p>
<h4 class='c012'>THE UNKNOWABLE.</h4>
<p class='c005'>When Mr. Spencer announces the content
of the “unknowable” to be “ultimate
religious and scientific ideas,” we are reminded
at once of the old adage in jurisprudence—“<i>Omnis
definitio in jure civili
est periculosa</i>;” the definition is liable to
prove self-contradictory in practice. So
when we have a content assigned to the
unknowable we at once inquire, whence
come the distinctions in the unknowable?
If unknown they are not distinct to us.
When we are told that Time, Space, Force,
Matter, God, Creation, etc., are unknowables,
we must regard these words as corresponding
to no distinct objects, but
rather as all of the same import to us. It
should be always borne in mind that <i>all
universal negatives are self-contradictory</i>.
Moreover, since all judgments are made by
subjective intelligences, it follows that all
general assertions concerning the nature
of the intellect affect the judgment itself.
The naïveté with which certain writers
wield these double-edged weapons is a
source of solicitude to the spectator.</p>

<p class='c006'>When one says that he knows that he
knows nothing, he asserts knowledge and
denies it in the same sentence. If one
says “all knowledge is relative,” as Spencer
does, (p. 68, <i>et seq.</i>, of First Principles,)
he of course asserts that his knowledge of
the fact is relative and not absolute. If a
distinct content is asserted of ignorance,
the same contradiction occurs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The perception of this principle by the
later German philosophers at once led
them out of the Kantian nightmare, into
positive truth. The principle may be applied
in general to any subjective scepticism.
The following is a general scheme
that will apply to all particular instances:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. “We cannot know things in themselves;
all our knowledge is subjective; it
is confined to our own states and changes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>II. If this is so, then still more is what
we name the “objective” only a state or
change of us as subjective; it is a mere
fiction of the mind so far as it is regarded
as a “beyond” or thing in itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. Hence we <i>do</i> know the objective;
for the scepticism can only legitimately
conclude that the objective which we do
know is of a nature kindred with reason;
and that by an <i>a priori</i> necessity we can
affirm that not only all knowable must
have this nature, but also <i>all possible existence</i>
must.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this we discover that the mistake on
the part of the sceptic consists in taking
self-conscious intelligence as something
one-sided or subjective, whereas it must
be, according to its very definition, subject
and object in one, and thus universal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The difficulty underlying this stage of
consciousness is that the mind has not
been cultivated to a clear separation of
the imagination from the thinking. As
Sir Wm. Hamilton remarks, (Metaphysics,
p. 487,) “Vagueness and confusion are
produced by the confounding of objects so
different as the images of sense and the
unpicturable notions of intelligence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Indeed the great “law of the conditioned”
so much boasted of by that philosopher
himself and his disciples, vanishes at
once when the mentioned confusion is
avoided. Applied to space it results as
follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>I.—<i>Thought of Space.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>1. Space, if finite, must be limited from
without;</p>

<p class='c006'>2. But such external limitations would
require space to exist in;</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And hence the supposed limits of
space that were to make it finite do in fact
<i>continue it</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears, therefore, that space is of
such a nature that it can only end in, or be
limited by <i>itself</i> and thus is universally
<i>continuous</i> or <i>infinite</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>II.—<i>Imagination of Space.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>If the result attained by pure thought is
correct, space is infinite, and if so, it cannot
be imagined. If, however, it should
be found possible to compass it by imagination,
it must be conceded that there
really is a contradiction in the intelligence.
That the result of such an attempt coincides
with our anticipations we have Hamilton’s
testimony—“imagination sinks exhausted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore, instead of this result contradicting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the first, as Hamilton supposes, it
really confirms it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In fact if the mind is disciplined to
separate pure thinking from mere imagining,
the infinite is not difficult to think.
Spinoza saw and expressed this by making
a distinction between “infinitum actu
(or rationis),” and “infinitum imaginationis,”
and his first and second axioms
are the immediate results of thought elevated
to this clearness. This distinction
and his “<i>omnis determinatio est negatio</i>,”
together with the development of the third
stage of thinking (according to reason),
“<i>sub quadam specie æternitatis</i>,”—these
distinctions are the priceless legacy of the
clearest-minded thinker of modern times;
and it behooves the critic of “human
knowing” to consider well the results that
the “human mind” has produced through
those great masters—Plato and Aristotle,
Spinoza and Hegel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Herbert Spencer, however, not only betrays
unconsciousness of this distinction,
but employs it in far grosser and self-destructive
applications. On page 25,
(“First Principles,”) he says: “When on
the sea shore we note how the hulls of distant
vessels are hidden below the horizon,
and how of still remoter vessels only the
uppermost sails are visible, we realize with
tolerable clearness the slight curvature of
that portion of the sea’s surface which lies
before us. But when we seek in imagination
to follow out this curved surface as it
actually exists, slowly bending round until
all its meridians meet in a point eight
thousand miles below our feet, we find
ourselves utterly baffled. We cannot conceive
in its real form and magnitude even
that small segment of our globe which extends
a hundred miles on every side of us,
much less the globe as a whole. The piece
of rock on which we stand can be mentally
represented with something like completeness;
we find ourselves able to think of
its top, its sides, and its under surface at
the same time, or so nearly at the same
time that they seem all present in consciousness
together; and so we can form
what we call a conception of the rock, but
to do the like with the earth we find impossible.”
“We form of the earth not a
conception properly so-called, but only a
symbolic conception.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Conception here is held to be adequate
when it is formed of an object of a given
size; when the object is above that size the
conception thereof becomes symbolical.
Here we do not have the exact limit stated,
though we have an example given (a rock)
which is conceivable, and another (the
earth) which is not.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We must predicate nothing of objects
too great or too multitudinous to be mentally
represented, or we must make our
predications by means of extremely inadequate
representations of such objects, mere
symbols of them.” (27 page.)</p>

<p class='c006'>But not only is the earth an indefinitely
multiple object, but so is the rock; nay,
even the smallest grain of sand. Suppose
the rock to be a rod in diameter; microscope
magnifying two and a half millions
of diameters would make its apparent magnitude
as large as the earth. It is thus
only a question of relative distance from
the person conceiving, and this reduces it
to the mere sensuous image of the retina.
Remove the earth to the distance of the
moon, and our conception of it would, upon
these principles, become quite adequate.
But if our conception of the moon be held
inadequate, then must that of the rock or
the grain of sand be equally inadequate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever occupies space is continuous
and discrete; i. e., may be divided into
parts. It is hence a question of relativity
whether the image or picture of it correspond
to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The legitimate conclusion is that all our
conceptions are symbolic, and if that property
invalidates their reliability, it follows
that we have no reliable knowledge
of things perceived, whether great or small.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mathematical knowledge is conversant
with pure lines, points, and surfaces; hence
it must rest on inconceivables.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Mr. Spencer would by no means concede
that we do not know the shape of the
earth, its size, and many other inconceivable
things about it. Conception is thus
no criterion of knowledge, and all built
upon this doctrine (i. e. depending upon
the conceivability of a somewhat) falls to
the ground.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>But he applies it to the questions of the
divisibility of matter (page 50): “If we
say that matter is infinitely divisible, we
commit ourselves to a supposition not
realizable in thought. We can bisect and
rebisect a body, and continually repeating
the act until we reduce its parts to a size
no longer physically divisible, may then
mentally continue the process without
limit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Setting aside conceivability as indifferent
to our knowledge or thinking, we have
the following solution of this point:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That which is extended may be bisected
(i. e. has two halves).</p>

<p class='c006'>II. Thus two extensions arise, which, in
turn, have the same property of divisibility
that the first one had.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. Since, then, bisection is a process
entirely indifferent to the nature of extension
(i. e. does not change an extension
into two non-extendeds), it follows that
body is infinitely divisible.</p>

<p class='c006'>We do not have to test this in imagination
to verify it; and this very truth must
be evident to him who says that the progress
must be “continued without limit.”
For if we examine the general conditions
under which any such “infinite progress”
is possible, we find them to rest upon the
presupposition of a real infinite, thus:</p>
<h4 class='c012'>Infinite Progress.</h4>
<p class='c005'>I. Certain attributes are found to belong
to an object, and are not affected by
a certain process. (For example, divisibility
as a process in space does not affect
the continuity of space, which makes that
process possible. Or again, the process of
limiting space does not interfere with its
continuity, for space will not permit any
limit except space itself.)</p>

<p class='c006'>II. When the untutored reflection endeavors
to apprehend a relation of this
nature, it seizes one side of the dualism
and is hurled to the other. (It bisects
space, and then finds itself before two objects
identical in nature with the first; it
has effected nothing; it repeats the process,
and, by and by getting exhausted,
wonders whether it could meet a different
result if its powers of endurance were
greater. Or else suspecting the true case,
says; “no other result would happen if I
went on forever.”)</p>

<p class='c006'>III. Pure thought, however, grasps this
process as a totality, and sees that it only
arises through a self-relation. The “progress”
is nothing but a return to itself,
the same monotonous round. It would be
a similar attempt to seek the end of a circle
by travelling round it, and one might
make the profound remark: “If my powers
were equal to the task, I should doubtless
come to the end.” This difficulty
vanishes as soon as the experience is made
that the line returns into itself. “It is the
same thing whether said once or repeated
forever,” says Simplicius, treating of this
paradox.</p>

<p class='c006'>The “Infinite Progress” is the most
stubborn fortress of Scepticism. By it
our negative writers establish the impotency
of Reason for various ulterior purposes.
Some wish to use it as a lubricating
fluid upon certain religious dogmas
that cannot otherwise be swallowed. Others
wish to save themselves the trouble of
thinking out the solutions to the Problem
of Life. But the Sphinx devours him who
does not faithfully grapple with, and solve
her enigmas.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mephistopheles (a good authority on this
subject) says of Faust, whom he finds
grumbling at the littleness of man’s mind:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Verachte nur Vernunft und Wissenchaft,</div>
      <div class='line'>Des Menschen allerhöchste Kraft!</div>
      <div class='line'>Und hätt’er sich auch nicht dem Teufel übergeben,</div>
      <div class='line'>Er müsste doch zu Grunde gehen.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Only prove that there is a large field of
the unknowable and one has at once the
<i>vade mecum</i> for stupidity. Crude reflection
can pour in its distinctions into a subject,
and save itself from the consequences
by pronouncing the basis incomprehensible.
It also removes <i>all</i> possibility of
Theology, or of the Piety of the Intellect,
and leaves a very narrow margin for religious
sentiment, or the Piety of the
Heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stage of Science represented by the
French Encyclopædists was immediately
hostile to each and every form of religion.
This second stage, however, has a choice.
It can, like Hamilton or Mansel, let religious
belief alone, as pertaining to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>unknown and unknowable—which may be
<i>believed</i> in as much as one likes; or it may
“strip off,” as Spencer does, “determinations
from a religion,” by which it is distinguished
from other religions, and show
their truth to consist in a common doctrine
held by all, to-wit: “The truth of
things is unknowable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the scientific man can baffle all attacks
from the religious standpoint; nay,
he can even elicit the most unbounded approval,
while he saps the entire structure
of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Says Spencer (p. 46): “Science and Religion
agree in this, that the power which
the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.”
He goes on to show that
though this harmony exists, yet it is
broken by the inconsistency of Religion:
“For every religion, setting out with the
tacit assertion of a mystery, forthwith
proceeds to give some solution of this
mystery, and so asserts that it is not a
mystery passing human comprehension.”
In this confession he admits that all religions
agree in professing to <i>reveal</i> the solution
of the Mystery of the Universe to man;
and they agree, moreover, that man, as
simply a being of sense and reflection, cannot
comprehend the revelation; but that
he must first pass through a profound mediation—be
<i>regenerated</i>, not merely in his
heart, but in <i>intellect</i> also. The misty
limitations (“vagueness and confusion”)
of the imagination must give way to the
purifying dialectic of pure thought before
one can see the Eternal Verities.</p>

<p class='c006'>These revelations profess to make known
the nature of the Absolute. They call the
Absolute “Him,” “Infinite,” “Self-created,”
“Self-existent,” “Personal,” and
ascribe to this “Him” attributes implying
profound mediation. All definite forms
of religion, all definite theology, must at
once be discarded according to Spencer’s
principle. Self-consciousness, even, is regarded
as impossible by him (p. 65):
“Clearly a true cognition of self implies a
state in which the knowing and known are
one, in which subject and object are identified;
and this Mr. Mansel rightly holds
to be the annihilation of both.” He considers
it a degradation (p. 109) to apply
personality to God: “Is it not possible
that there is a mode of being as much
transcending intelligence and will as these
transcend mechanical motion?” And
again (p. 112) he holds that the mere
“negation of absolute knowing contains
more religion than all dogmatic theology.”
(P. 121,) “All religions are envelopes of
truth, which reveal to the lower and conceal
to the higher.” (P. 66,) “Objective
and subjective things are alike inscrutable
in their substance and genesis.” “Ultimate
religious and scientific ideas (p. 68)
alike turn out to be mere symbols of the
actual, and not cognitions of it.” (P. 69,)
“We come to the negative result that the
reality existing behind all appearances
must ever be unknown.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In these passages we see a dualism posited
in this form: “Everything immediate
is <i>phenomenal</i>, a manifestation of the hidden
and inscrutable essence.” This essence
is the unknown and unknowable;
yet it <i>manifests</i> itself in the immediate or
phenomenal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first stage of thought was unconscious
that it dealt all the time with a
mediated result (a dualism) while it assumed
an immediate; that it asserted all
truth to lie in the sensuous object, while it
named at the same time “<i>matter</i> and <i>force</i>,”
categories of reflection.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second stage has got over <i>that</i> difficulty,
but has fallen into another. For
if the phenomenon <i>manifested</i> the essence,
it could not be said to be “unknowable,
hidden, and inscrutable.” But if the essence
is <i>not</i> manifested by the phenomenon,
then we have the so-called phenomenon
as a self-existent, and therefore independent
of the so-called essence, which
stands coördinated to it as another existent,
which cannot be known because it
does not manifest itself to us. Hence the
“phenomenon” is no <i>phenomenon</i>, or
manifestation of aught but itself, and the
“essence” is simply a fiction of the philosopher.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence his talk about essence is purely
gratuitous, for there is not shown the need
of one.</p>

<p class='c006'>A dialectical consideration of essence
and phenomenon will result as follows:</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>Essence and Phenomenon.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>I. If essence is seized as independent
or absolute being, it may be taken in two
senses:</p>

<p class='c006'><i>a.</i> As entirely unaffected by “otherness”
(or limitation) and entirely undetermined;
and this would be pure nothing,
for it cannot distinguish itself or be distinguished
from pure nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>b.</i> As relating to itself, and hence
making itself a duality—becoming its own
other; in this case the “other” is a vanishing
one, for it is at the same time identical
and non-identical—a process in
which the essence may be said to appear
or become <i>phenomenal</i>. The entire process
is the absolute or self-related (and
hence independent). It is determined, but
by itself, and hence not in a finite manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The Phenomenon is thus seen to
arise through the self-determination of
essence, and has obviously the following
characteristics:</p>

<p class='c006'><i>a.</i> It is the “other” of the essence, and
yet the own self of the essence existing in
this opposed manner, and thus self-nugatory;
and this non-abiding character gives
it the name of phenomenon (or that which
merely <i>appears</i>, but is no permanent essence).</p>

<p class='c006'><i>b.</i> If this were simply another to the
essence, and not the self-opposition of the
same, then it would be through itself, and
<i>itself</i> the essence in its first (or immediate)
phase. But this is the essence only as negated,
or as returned from the otherness.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>c.</i> This self-nugatoriness is seen to arise
from the contradiction involved in its being
other to itself, i. e. outside of its true
being. <i>Without</i> this self-nugatoriness it
would be an abiding, an essence itself, and
hence no phenomenon; <i>with</i> this self-nugatoriness
the phenomenon simply exhibits
or “manifests” the essence; in fact,
with the appearance and its negation taken
together, we have before us a totality of
essence and phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. Therefore: <i>a.</i> The phenomenal is
such because it is not an abiding somewhat.
It is dependent upon other or essence.
<i>b.</i> Whatever it posesses belongs
to that upon which it depends, i. e. belongs
to essence. <i>c.</i> In the self-nugatoriness
of the phenomenal we have the entire
essence manifested.</p>

<p class='c006'>This latter point is the important result,
and may-be stated in a less strict and more
popular form thus: The real world (so-called)
is said to be in a state of change—origination
and decay. Things pass away
and others come in their places. Under
this change, however, there is a permanent
called Essence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The imaginative thinking finds it impossible
to realize such an abiding as exists
through the decay of all external form,
and hence pronounces it unknowable. But
pure thought seizes it, and finds it a pure
self-relation or process of return to itself,
which accordingly has duality, thus:
<i>a.</i> The positing or producing of a somewhat
or an immediate, and, <i>b.</i> The cancelling
of the same. In this duality of beginning
and ceasing, this self-relation
completes its circle, and is thus, <i>c.</i> the entire
movement.</p>

<p class='c006'>All categories of the understanding
(cause and effect, matter and form, possibility,
etc.) are found to contain this
movement when dissolved. And hence
they have self-determination for their presupposition
and explanation. It is unnecessary
to add that unless one gives up
trying to <i>imagine</i> truth, that this is all
very absurd reasoning. (At the end of the
sixth book of Plato’s Republic, ch. xxi.,
and in the seventh book, ch. xiii., one may
see how clearly this matter was understood
two thousand, and more, years ago.)</p>

<p class='c006'>To manifest or reveal is to make known;
and hence to speak of the “manifestation
of a hidden and inscrutable essence” is to
speak of the making known of an unknowable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Spencer goes on; no hypothesis of
the universe is possible—creation not conceivable,
for that would be something out
of nothing—self-existence not conceivable,
for that involves unlimited past time.</p>

<p class='c006'>He holds that “all knowledge is <i>relative</i>,”
for all explanation is the reducing
of a cognition to a more general. He says,
(p. 69,) “Of necessity, therefore, explanation
must eventually bring us down to the
inexplicable—the deepest truth which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>can get at must be unaccountable.” This
much valued insight has a positive side as
well as the negative one usually developed:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. (<i>a.</i>) To explain something we subsume
it under a more general.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b.</i>) The “<i>summum genus</i>” cannot be
subsumed, and</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c.</i>) Hence is inexplicable.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. But those who conclude from this
that we base our knowledge ultimately
upon faith (from the supposed fact than we
cannot prove our premises) forget that—</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>a.</i>) If the subsuming process ends in an
unknown, then all the subsuming has resulted
in nothing; for to subsume something
under an unknown does not explain
it. (Plato’s Republic, Book VII, chap. xiii.)</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b.</i>) The more general, however, is the
more simple, and hence the “<i>summum
genus</i>” is the purely simple—it is Being.
But the simpler the clearer, and the pure
simple is the absolutely clear.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c.</i>) At the “<i>summum genus</i>” subsumption
becomes the principle of identity—being
is being; and thus stated we have
simple self-relation as the origin of all
clearness and knowing whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. Hence it is seen that it is not the
mere fact of subsumption that makes something
clear, but rather it is the reduction
of it to identity.</p>

<p class='c006'>In pure being as the <i>summum genus</i>, the
mind contemplates the pure form of knowing—“a
is a,” or “a subject is a predicate”—(a
is b). The pure “is” is the
empty form of mental affirmation, the pure
copula; and thus in the <i>summum genus</i>
the mind recognizes the pure form of itself.
All objectivity is at this point dissolved
into the thinking, and hence the subsumption
becomes identity—(being = <i>ego</i>, or “<i>cogito,
ergo sum</i>”;) the process turns round
and becomes synthetic, (“dialectic” or
“genetic,” as called by some). From this
it is evident that self-consciousness is the
basis of all knowledge.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CHAPTER III. <br /> THE “FIRST PRINCIPLES” OF THE “KNOWABLE.”</h4>
<p class='c005'>As might be expected from Spencer’s
treatment of the <i>unknowable</i>, the <i>knowable</i>
will prove a confused affair; especially
since to the above-mentioned “inscrutability”
of the absolute, he adds the doctrine
of an “obscure consciousness of it,”
holding, in fact, that the knowable is only
a relative, and that it cannot be known
without at the same time possessing a
knowledge of the unknowable.</p>

<p class='c006'>(P. 82) he says: “A thought involves
relation, difference and likeness; whatever
does not present each of them does
not admit of cognition. And hence we
may say that the unconditioned as presenting
none of these, is trebly unthinkable.”
And yet he says, (p. 96): “The relative is
itself inconceivable except as related to a
real non-relative.”</p>

<p class='c006'>We will leave this infinite self-contradiction
thus developed, and turn to the positions
established concerning the knowable.
They concern the nature of Force, Matter
and Motion, and the predicates set up are
“persistence,” “indestructibility” and
similar.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>THE KNOWABLE.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Although in the first part “conceivability”
was shown to be utterly inadequate
as a test of truth; that with it we could not
even establish that the earth is round, or
that space is infinitely continuous, yet here
Mr. Spencer finds that inconceivability is
the most convenient of all positive proofs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first example to be noticed is his
proof of the compressibility of matter (p.
51): “It is an established mechanical
truth that if a body moving at a given velocity,
strikes an equal body at rest in
such wise that the two move on together,
their joint velocity will be but half that of
the striking body. Now it is a law of
which the negative is inconceivable, that
in passing from any one degree of magnitude
to another all intermediate degrees
must be passed through. Or in the case
before us, a body moving at velocity 4,
cannot, by collision, be reduced to velocity
2, without passing through all velocities
between 4 and 2. But were matter truly
solid—were its units absolutely incompressible
and in unbroken contact—this
‘law of continuity, as it is called, would
be broken in every case of collision. For
when, of two such units, one moving at velocity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>4 strikes another at rest, the striking
unit must have its velocity 4 instantaneously
reduced to velocity 2; must pass
from velocity 4 to velocity 2 without any
lapse of time, and without passing through
intermediate velocities; must be moving
with velocities 4 and 2 at the same instant,
which is impossible.” On page 57 he acknowledges
that any transition from one
rate of motion to another is inconceivable;
hence it does not help the matter to “pass
through intermediate velocities.” It is
just as great a contradiction and just as
inconceivable that velocity 4 should become
velocity 3.9999+, as it is that it
should become velocity 2; for no change
whatever of the motion can be thought (as
he confesses) without having two motions
in one time. Motion, in fact, is the synthesis
of place and time, and cannot be
comprehended except as their unity. The
argument here quoted is only adduced by
Mr. S. for the purpose of antithesis to other
arguments on the other side as weak as
itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>On page 241, Mr. Spencer deals with the
question of the destructibility of matter:
“The annihilation of matter is unthinkable
for the same reason that the creation
of matter is unthinkable.” (P. 54): “Matter
in its ultimate nature is as absolutely
incomprehensible as space and time.” The
nature of matter is unthinkable, its creation
or destructibility is unthinkable, and
in this style of reasoning we can add that
its <i>indestructibility</i> is likewise unthinkable;
in fact the argument concerning self-existence
will apply here. (P. 31): “Self-existence
necessarily means existence without
a beginning; and to form a conception
of self-existence is to form a conception of
existence without a beginning. Now by
no mental effort can we do this. To conceive
existence through infinite past time,
implies the conception of infinite past time,
which is an impossibility.” Thus, too,
we might argue in a strain identical; indestructibility
implies existence through
infinite future time, but by no mental effort
can infinite time be conceived. And thus,
too, we prove and disprove the persistence
of force and motion. When occasion requires,
the ever-convenient argument of
“inconceivability” enters. It reminds
one of Sir Wm. Hamilton’s “imbecility”
upon which are based “sundry of the most
important phenomena of intelligence,”
among which he mentions the category of
causality. If causality is founded upon
imbecility, and all experience upon <i>it</i>, it
follows that all empirical knowledge rests
upon imbecility.</p>

<p class='c006'>On page 247, our author asserts that the
first law of motion “is in our day being
merged in the more general one, that motion,
like matter, is indestructible.” It is
interesting to observe that this so-called
“First law of motion” rests on no better
basis than very crude reflection.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When not influenced by external forces,
a moving body will go on in a straight
line with a uniform velocity,” is Spencer’s
statement of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>This abstract, supposed law has necessitated
much scaffolding in Natural Philosophy
that is otherwise entirely unnecessary;
it contradicts the idea of momentum,
and is thus refuted:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. A body set in motion continues in
motion after the impulse has ceased from
without, for the reason that it retains momentum.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. Momentum is the product of weight
by velocity, and weight is the attraction of
the body in question to another body external
to it. If all bodies external to the
moving body were entirely removed, the
latter would have no weight, and hence
the product of weight by velocity would
be zero.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The “external influences” referred
to in the so-called “law,” mean chiefly
attraction. Since no body could have momentum
except through weight, another
name for attraction, it follows that all free
motion has reference to another body, and
hence is curvilinear; thus we are rid of
that embarrassing “straight line motion”
which gives so much trouble in mechanics.
It has all to be reduced back again through
various processes to curvilinear movement.</p>

<p class='c006'>We come, finally, to consider the central
point of this system:</p>
<h4 class='c012'>THE CORRELATION OF FORCES.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Speaking of persistence of force, Mr.
Spencer concedes (p. 252) that this doctrine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>is not demonstrable from experience.
He says (p. 254): “Clearly the persistence
of force is an ultimate truth of which no
inductive proof is possible.” (P. 255):
“By the persistence of force we really
mean the persistence of some power which
transcends our knowledge and conception.”
(P. 257): “The indestructibility of matter
and the continuity of motion we saw to be
really corollaries from the impossibility of
establishing in thought a relation between
something and nothing.” (Thus what
was established as a mental impotence is
now made to have objective validity.)
“Our inability to conceive matter and
motion destroyed is our inability to suppress
consciousness itself.” (P. 258):
“Whoever alleges that the inability to conceive
a beginning or end of the universe
is a <i>negative</i> result of our mental structure,
cannot deny that our consciousness
of the universe as persistent is a positive
result of our mental structure. And this
persistence of the universe is the persistence
of that unknown cause, power, or
force, which is manifested to us through
all phenomena.” This “positive result of
our mental structure” is said to rest on
our “inability to conceive the limitation
of consciousness” which is “simply the
obverse of our inability to put an end to
the thinking subject while still continuing
to think.” (P. 257): “To think of something
becoming nothing, would involve
that this substance of consciousness having
just existed under a given form, should
next assume no form, or should cease to
be consciousness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be observed here that he is endeavoring
to solve the First Antinomy of
Kant, and that his argument in this place
differs from Kant’s proof of the “Antithesis”
in this, that while Kant proves that
“The world [or universe] has no beginning,”
etc., by the impossibility of the
origination of anything in a “void time,”
that Mr. Spencer proves the same thing by
asserting it to be a “positive result of our
mental structure,” and then proceeds to
show that this is a sort of “inability”
which has a subjective explanation; it is,
according to him, merely the “substance
of consciousness” objectified and regarded
as the law of reality.</p>

<p class='c006'>But how is it with the “Thesis” to that
Antinomy, “The world <i>has</i> a beginning
in time?” Kant proves this apagogically
by showing the absurdity of an “infinite
series already elapsed.” That our
author did not escape the contradiction
has already been shown in our remarks
upon the “indestructibility of matter.”
While he was treating of the unknowable
it was his special province to prove that
self-existence is unthinkable. (P. 31): He
says it means “existence without a beginning,”
and “to conceive existence through
infinite past time, implies the conception
of infinite past time, which is an impossibility.”
Thus we have the Thesis of the
Antinomy supported in his doctrine of the
“unknowable,” and the antithesis of the
same proved in the doctrine of the knowable.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall next find him involved with
Kant’s Third Antinomy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The doctrine of the correlation is stated
in the following passages:</p>

<p class='c006'>(P. 280): “Those modes of the unknowable,
which we call motion, heat,
light, chemical affinity, etc., are alike
transformable into each other, and into
those modes of the unknowable which we
distinguish as sensation, emotion, thought:
these, in their turns, being directly or indirectly
re-transformable into the original
shapes. That no idea or feeling arises,
save as a result of some physical force expended
in producing it, is fast becoming a
common-place of science; and whoever
duly weighs the evidence, will see that
nothing but an overwhelming bias in favor
of a preconceived theory can explain its
non-acceptance. How this metamorphosis
takes place—how a force existing as motion,
heat, or light, can become a mode of
consciousness—how it is possible for aërial
vibrations to generate the sensation we
call sound, or for the forces liberated by
chemical changes in the brain to give rise
to emotion—these are mysteries which it
is impossible to fathom.” (P. 284): “Each
manifestation of force can be interpreted
only as the effect of some antecedent force;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>no matter whether it be an inorganic action,
an animal movement, a thought, or a
feeling. Either this must be conceded, or
else it must be asserted that our successive
states of consciousness are self-created.”
“Either mental energies as well as bodily
ones are quantitatively correlated to certain
energies expended in their production,
and to certain other energies they initiate;
or else nothing must become something
and something, nothing. Since persistence
of force, being a <i>datum</i> of consciousness,
cannot be denied, its unavoidable corollary
must be accepted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On p. 294 he supports the doctrine that
“motion takes the direction of the least
resistance,” mentally as well as physically.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here are some of the inferences to be
drawn from the passages quoted:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Every act is determined from without,
and hence does not belong to the subject
in which it manifests itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. To change the course of a force, is to
make another direction “that of the least
resistance,” or to remove or diminish a
resistance.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. But to change a resistance requires
force, which (in motion) must act in “the
direction of the least resistance,” and
hence it is entirely determined from without,
and governed by the disposition of
the forces it meets.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Hence, of <i>will</i>, it is an absurdity to
talk; <i>freedom</i> or <i>moral agency</i> is an impossible
phantom.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. That there is self-determination in
self-consciousness—that it is “self-created”—is
to Mr. Spencer the absurd alternative
which at once turns the scale in
favor of the doctrine that mental phenomena
are the productions of external
forces.</p>

<p class='c006'>After this, what are we to say of the
following? (P. 501): “Notwithstanding
all evidence to the contrary, there will
probably have arisen in not a few minds
the conviction that the solutions which
have been given, along with those to be
derived from them, are essentially materialistic.
Let none persist in these misconceptions.”
(P. 502): “Their implications
are no more materialistic than they
are spiritualistic, and no more spiritualistic
than they are materialistic.”</p>

<p class='c006'>If we hold these positions by the side of
Kant’s Third Antinomy, we shall see that
they all belong to the proof of the “Antithesis,”
viz: “There is no freedom, but
everything in the world happens according
to the laws of nature.” The “Thesis,”
viz: “That a causality of freedom is necessary
to account fully for the phenomena
of the world,” he has not anywhere supported.
We find, in fact, only those
thinkers who have in some measure mastered
the third phase of culture in thought,
standing upon the basis presented by
Kant in the Thesis. The chief point in
the Thesis may be stated as follows: 1.
If everything that happens presupposes a
previous condition, (which the law of
causality states,) 2. This previous condition
cannot be a permanent (or have been
always in existence); for, if so, its consequence,
or the effect, would have always
existed. Thus the previous condition must
be a thing which has happened. 3. With
this the whole law of causality collapses;
for (<i>a</i>) since each cause is an effect, (<i>b</i>) its
determining power escapes into a higher
member of the series, and, (<i>c</i>) unless the
law changes, wholly vanishes; there result
an indefinite series of effects with no
cause; each member of the series is a dependent,
has its being in another, which
again has its being in another, and hence
cannot support the subsequent term.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence it is evident that this Antinomy
consists, first: in the setting up of the law
of causality as having absolute validity,
which is the antithesis. Secondly, the
experience is made that such absolute law
of causality is a self-nugatory one, and thus
it is to be inferred that causality, to be at
all, presupposes an origination in a “self-moved,”
as Plato calls it. Aristotle (Metaphysics,
xi. 6-7, and ix. 8) exhibits this ultimate
as the “self-active,” and the Scholastics
take the same, under the designation
“<i>actus purus</i>,” for the definition of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Antinomy thus reduced gives:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Thesis: Self-determination must lie
at the basis of all causality, otherwise
causality cannot be at all.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>II. Antithesis: If there is self-determination,
“the unity of experience (which
leads us to look for a cause) is destroyed,
and hence no such case could arise in experience.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In comparing the two proofs it is at once
seen that they are of different degrees of
universality. The argument of the Thesis is
based upon the nature of the thing itself,
i. e. a pure thought; while that of the
Antithesis loses sight of the idea of
“<i>efficient</i>” cause, and seeks mere continuity
in the sequence of time, and thus exhibits
itself as the second stage of thought,
which leans on the staff of fancy, i. e. mere
<i>representative</i> thinking. This “unity of
experience,” as Kant calls it, is the same
thing, stated in other words, that Spencer
refers to as the “positive result of our
mental structure.” In one sense those are
true antinomies—those of Kant, Hamilton,
<i>et al.</i>—viz. in this: that the “<i>representative</i>”
stage of thinking finds itself unable
to shake off the sensuous picture, and think
“<i>sub quadam specie æternitatis</i>.” To the
mind disciplined to the third stage of
thought, these are no antinomies; Spinoza,
Leibnitz, Plato and Aristotle are not confused
by them. The Thesis, properly
stated, is a true universal, and exhibits its
own truth, as that upon which the law of
causality rests; and hence the antithesis
itself—less universal—resting upon the
law of causality, is based upon the Thesis.
Moreover, the Thesis does not deny an infinite
succession in time and space, it only
states that there must be an efficient cause—just
what the law of causality states, but
shows, in addition, that this efficient cause
must be a “self-determined.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On page 282 we learn that, “The solar
heat is the final source of the force manifested
by society.” “It (the force of society)
is based on animal and vegetable
products, and these in turn are dependent
on the light and heat of the sun.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As an episode in this somewhat abstract
discussion, it may be diverting to notice
the question of priority of discovery,
touched upon in the following note (p.
454): “Until I recently consulted his
‘Outlines of Astronomy’ on another question,
I was not aware that, so far back as
1833, Sir John Herschel had enunciated
the doctrine that ‘the sun’s rays are the
ultimate source of almost every motion
which takes place on the surface of the
earth.’ He expressly includes all geologic,
meteorologic, and vital actions; as also
those which we produce by the combustion
of coal. The late George Stephenson
appears to have been wrongly credited
with this last idea.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to add to the thorough discussion
of this important question, we wish
to suggest the claims of Thomas Carlyle,
who, as far back as 1830, wrote the following
passage in his <i>Sartor Resartus</i> (Am.
ed. pp. 55-6): “Well sang the Hebrew
Psalmist: ‘If I take the wings of the
morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts
of the Universe, God is there.’ Thou, too,
O cultivated reader, who too probably art
no psalmist, but a prosaist, knowing God
only by tradition, knowest thou any corner
of the world where at least force is not?
The drop which thou shakest from thy wet
hand, rests not where it falls, but to-morrow
thou findest it swept away; already,
on the wings of the north wind, it is nearing
the tropic of Cancer. How it came to
evaporate and not lie motionless? Thinkest
thou there is aught motionless, without
force, and dead?</p>

<p class='c006'>“As I rode through the Schwartzwald,
I said to myself: That little fire which
glows starlike across the dark-growing
(nachtende) moor, where the sooty smith
bends over his anvil, and thou hopest to
replace thy lost horseshoe—is it a detached,
separated speck, cut off from the whole
universe, or indissolubly joined to the
whole? Thou fool, that smithy-fire was
primarily kindled at the sun; is fed by air
that circulates from beyond Noah’s deluge,
from beyond the Dog star; it is a little
ganglion, or nervous centre in the great
vital system of immensity.”</p>

<p class='c006'>We have, finally, to consider the correlation
theory in connection with equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Motion results from destroyed equilibrium.
The whole totality does not correspond
to itself, its ideal and real contradict
each other. The movement is the restoring
of the equilibrium, or the bringing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>into unity of the ideal and real. To illustrate:
a spring (made of steel, rubber, or
any elastic material) has a certain form in
which, it may exist without tension; this
may be called the ideal shape, or simply
the ideal. If the spring is forced to assume
another shape, its real shape becomes
different from the ideal; its equilibrium
is destroyed, and force is manifested as a
tendency to restore the equilibrium (or
unity of the ideal and real). Generalize
this: all forces have the same nature;
(<i>a</i>) <i>expansive</i> forces arise from the ideal
existing without—a gas, steam, for example,
ideally takes up a more extended
space than it has really; it expands to fill
it. Or (<i>b</i>) contractive forces: the multiplicity
ideally exists within; e. g. attraction
of gravitation; matter trying to find
the centre of the earth, its ideal. The will
acts in this way: The ideal is changed
first, and draws the real after it. I first
destroy, in thought and will, the identity
of ideal and real; the tension resulting is
force. Thinking, since it deals with the
universal (or the potential <i>and</i> the actual)
is an original source of force, and, as will
result in the sequel from a reverse analysis
(see below, V. 3, <i>c</i>) the <i>only</i> source of force.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. Persistence of force requires an unrestorable
equilibrium; in moving to restore
one equilibrium, it must destroy
another—its equivalent.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. But this contradicts the above developed
conception of force as follows:
(<i>a</i>) Since force results from destroyed
equilibrium, it follows (<i>b</i>) that it requires
as much force to destroy the equilibrium
as is developed in the restoring of it (and
this notion is the basis of the correlation
theory). But (<i>c</i>) if the first equilibrium
(already destroyed) can only be restored
by the destroying of another equal to the
same, it has already formed an equilibrium
with the second, and the occasion of the
motion is removed.</p>

<p class='c006'>If two forces are equal and opposed,
which will give way?</p>

<p class='c006'>By this dialectic consideration of force,
we learn the insufficiency of the theory of
correlation as the ultimate truth. Instead
of being “the sole truth, which transcends
experience by underlying it” (p. 258), we
are obliged to confess that this “persistence
of force” rests on the category of
causality; its thin disguise consists in the
substitution of other words for the metaphysical
expression, “Every effect must
be equal to its cause.” And this, when
tortured in the crucible, confesses that
the only efficient cause is “<i>causi sui</i>;”
hence the effect is equal to its cause, because
it is the cause.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the correlation theory results in
showing that force cannot be, unless self-originated.</p>

<p class='c006'>That self-determination is the inevitable
result, no matter what hypothesis be assumed,
is also evident. Taking all counter-hypotheses
and generalizing them, we have
this analysis:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Any and every being is determined
from without through another. (This theorem
includes all anti-self-determination
doctrines.)</p>

<p class='c006'>II. It results from this that any and
every being is dependent upon another and
is a finite one; it cannot be isolated without
destroying it. Hence it results that
every being is an element of a whole that
includes <i>it</i> as a subordinate moment.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. Dependent being, as a subordinate
element, cannot be said to support any
thing attached to it, for its own support is
not in itself but in another, namely, the
whole that includes it. From this it results
that no dependent being can depend
upon another dependent being, but rather
upon the including whole.</p>

<p class='c006'>The including whole is therefore not a
dependent; since it is for itself, and each
element is determined through it, and for
it, it may be called the <i>negative</i> unity (or
the unity which negates the independence
of the elements).</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Remark.</i>—A chain of dependent beings
collapses into one dependent being. Dependence
is not converted into independence
by simple multiplication. All dependence
is thus an element of an independent
whole.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. What is the <i>character</i> of this independent
whole, this <i>negative unity</i>? “Character”
means determination, and we are
prepared to say that its determination cannot
be through another, for then it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>be a dependent, and we should be referred
again to the whole, including it. Its determination
by which the multiplicity of
elements arises is hence its own self-determination.
Thus all finitude and dependence
presupposes as its condition, self-determination.</p>

<p class='c006'>V. Self-determination more closely examined
exhibits some remarkable results,
(which will throw light on the discussion
of “Essence and Phenomena” above):</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It is “<i>causa sui</i>;” active and passive;
existing dually as determining and
determined; this self-diremption produces
a distinction in itself which is again cancelled.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) As determiner (or active, or cause),
it is the pure universal—the <i>possibility of
any</i> determinations. But as <i>determined</i>
(passive or effect) it is the special, the particular,
the one-sided reality that enters
into change.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) But it is “negative unity” of these
two sides, and hence an individual. The
pure universal whose negative relation to
itself as determiner makes the particular,
completes itself to individuality through
this act.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>a.</i>) Since its pure universality is the
substrate of its determination, and at the
same time a self-related activity (or negativity),
it at once becomes its own object.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b.</i>) Its activity (limiting or determining)—a
pure negativity—turned to itself
as object, dissolves the particular in the
universal, and thus continually realizes
its subjectivity.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c.</i>) Hence these two sides of the negative
unity are more properly subject and
object, and since they are identical (<i>causa
sui</i>) we may name the result “self-consciousness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The absolute truth of all truths, then, is
that self-consciousness is the form of the
Total. God is a Person, or rather <i>the</i>
Person. Through His self-consciousness
(thought of Himself) he makes Himself
an object to Himself (Nature), and in the
same act cancels it again into His own
image (finite spirit), and thus comprehends
Himself in this self-revelation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two remarks must be made here: (1.)
This is not “Pantheism;” for it results
that God is a Person; and secondly Nature
is a self-cancelling side in the process;
thirdly, the so-called “finite spirit,” or
man, is immortal, since otherwise he would
not be the last link of the chain; but such
he is, because he can develop out of his
sensuous life to pure thought, unconditioned
by time and space, and hence he can
surpass any <i>fixed</i> “higher intelligence,”
no matter how high created.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It is the result that all profound
thinkers have arrived at.</p>

<p class='c006'>Aristotle (Metaphysics XI. 6 &amp; 7) carries
this whole question of motion back to
its presupposition in a mode of treatment,
“<i>sub quadam specie æternitatis</i>.” He
concludes thus: “The thinking, however,
of that which is purely for itself, is a thinking
of that which is most excellent in and
for itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The thinking thinks itself, however,
through participation in that which is
thought by it; it becomes this object in
its own activity, in such a manner that the
subject and object are identical. For the
apprehending of thought and essence is
what constitutes reason. The activity of
thinking produces that which is perceived;
so that the activity is rather that which
Reason seems to have of a divine nature;
speculation [pure thinking] is the most excellent
employment; if, then, God is always
engaged in this, as we are at times,
He is admirable, and if in a higher degree,
more admirable.  But He <i>is</i> in this pure
thinking, and life too belongs to Him; for
the activity of thought is life. He is this
activity. The activity, returning into itself,
is the most excellent and eternal life.
We say, therefore, that God is an eternal
and the best living being. So that life and
duration are uninterrupted and eternal;
for this is God.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When one gets rid of those “images of
sense” called by Spencer “conceivables,”
and arrives at the “unpicturable notions
of intelligence,” he will find it easy to reduce
the vexed antinomies of force, matter,
motion, time, space and causality; arriving
at the fundamental principle—self-determination—he
will be able to make a
science of Biology. The organic realm
will not yield to dualistic Reflection.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Goethe is the great pioneer of the school of
physicists that will spring out of the present
activity of Reflection when it shall
have arrived at a perception of its method.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Resumé.</i>—Mr. Spencer’s results, so far
as philosophy is concerned, may be briefly
summed up under four general heads: 1.
Psychology. 2. Ontology. 3. Theology.
4. Cosmology.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>PSYCHOLOGY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>(1.) Conception is a mere picture in the
mind; therefore what cannot be pictured
cannot be conceived; therefore the Infinite,
the Absolute, God, Essence, Matter, Motion,
Force—anything, in short, that involves
mediation—cannot be conceived; hence
they are unknowable.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Consciousness is self-knowing; but
that subject and object are one, is impossible.
We can neither know ourselves nor
any real being.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) All reasoning or explaining is the
subsuming of a somewhat under a more
general category; hence the highest category
is unsubsumed, and hence inexplicable.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) Our intellectual faculties may be
improved to a certain extent, and beyond
this, no amount of training can avail anything.
(Biology, vol. I, p. 188.)</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) The “substance of consciousness”
is the basis of our ideas of persistence of
Force, Matter, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) All knowing is relative; our knowledge
of this fact, however, is not relative
but absolute.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>ONTOLOGY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>(1.) All that we know is phenomenal.
The reality passes all understanding. In
the phenomenon the essence is “manifested,”
but still it is not revealed thereby;
it remains hidden behind it, inscrutable to
our perception.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) And yet, since all our knowledge is
relative, we have an obscure knowledge of
the hidden and inscrutable essence of the
correlate of our knowledge of phenomena.
We know that it exists.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Though what is inconceivable is for
that reason unknowable, yet we know that
persistence belongs to force, motion and
matter; it is a positive result of our “mental
structure,” although we cannot conceive
either destructibility or indestructibility.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) Though self-consciousness is an
impossibility, yet it sometimes occurs, since
the “substance of consciousness” is the
object of consciousness when it decides
upon the persistence of the Universe, and
of Force, Matter, etc.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>THEOLOGY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>The Supreme Being is unknown and unknowable;
unrevealed and unrevealable,
either naturally or supernaturally; for to
reveal, requires that some one shall comprehend
what is revealed. The sole doctrine
of Religion of great value is the doctrine
that God transcends the human intellect.
When Religion professes to reveal
Him to man and declare His attributes,
then it is irreligious. Though God is the
unknown, yet personality, reason, consciousness,
etc., are degrading when applied
to Him. The “Thirty-nine Articles”
should be condensed into one, thus:
“There is an Unknown which I know that I
cannot know.“</p>

<p class='c006'>“Religions are envelopes of truth which
reveal to the lower, and conceal to the
higher.” “They are modes of manifestation
of the unknowable.”</p>
<h4 class='c012'>COSMOLOGY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>“Evolution is a change from an indefinite,
incoherent homogeneity, to a definite,
coherent heterogeneity; through continuous
differentiations and integrations.”
This is the law of the Universe. All progresses
to an equilibration—to a moving
equilibrium.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>INTRODUCTION TO FICHTE’S SCIENCE OF KNOWLEDGE. <br /> TRANSLATED BY A. E. KROEGER.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Note.</span>—In presenting this “Introduction” to the readers of the Journal of Speculative
Philosophy, we believe we afford them the easiest means of gaining an insight into Fichte’s great
work on the Science of Knowledge. The present introduction was written by Fichte in 1797,
three years after the first publication of his full system. It is certainly written in a remarkably
clear and vigorous style, so as to be likely to arrest the attention even of those who have but
little acquaintance with the rudiments of the Science of Philosophy. This led us to give it
the preference over other essays, also written by Fichte, as Introductions to his Science of
Knowledge. A translation of the Science of Knowledge, by Mr. Kroeger, is at present in course
of publication in New York. This article is, moreover, interesting as being a more complete unfolding
of the doctrine of Plato upon Method, heretofore announced.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>
<h4 class='c012'>PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</h4>
<p class='c009'>De re, quæ agitur, petimus, ut homines, eam non
opinionem, sed opus esse, cogitent ac pro certo habeant,
non sectæ nos alicujus, aut placiti, sed utilitatis
et amplitudinis humanæ fundamenta moliri. Deinde,
ut, suis commodis æqui, in commune consulant, et ipsi
in partem veniant.—<i>Baco de Verulamio.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>The author of the Science of Knowledge
was soon convinced, through a slight acquaintance
with the philosophical literature
since the appearance of Kant’s Critiques,
that the object of this great man—to effect
a total reform in the study of philosophy,
and hence of all science—had resulted
in a failure, since not one of his
numerous successors appeared to understand
what he had really spoken of. The
author believed that he had understood
the latter; he resolved to devote his
life to a representation—totally independent
from Kant’s—of that great discovery,
and he will not give up this resolve.
Whether he will succeed better in making
himself understood to his age, time alone
can show. At all events, he knows that
nothing true and useful, which has once
been given to mankind, is lost, though only
remote posterity should learn how to use it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Determined by my academical vocation,
I wrote, in the first instance, for my hearers,
with whom it was in my power to explain
myself in words until I was understood.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is not the place to testify how
much cause I have to be satisfied with my
efforts, and to entertain, of some of my
students, the best hopes for science. That
book of mine has also become known elsewhere,
and there are various opinions
afloat concerning it amongst the learned.
A judgment, which even pretended to bring
forth arguments, I have neither read nor
heard, except from my students; but I
have both heard and read a vast amount of
derision, denunciation, and the general
assurance that everybody is heartily opposed
to this doctrine, and the confession
that no one can understand it. As far as
the latter is concerned, I will cheerfully
assume all the blame, until others shall represent
it so as to make it comprehensible,
when students will doubtless discover that
my representation was not so very bad
after all; or I will assume it altogether
and unconditionally, if the reader thereby
should be encouraged to study the present
representation, in which I shall endeavor
to be as clear as possible. I shall continue
these representations so long as I am
convinced that I do not write altogether in
vain. But I write in vain when nobody
examines my argument.</p>

<p class='c006'>I still owe my readers the following explanations:
I have always said, and say
again, that my system is the same as
Kant’s. That is to say, it contains the
same view of the subject, but is totally independent
of Kant’s mode of representation.
I have said this, not to cover myself
by a great authority, or to support my
doctrine except by itself, but in order to
say the truth and to be just.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps it may be proven after twenty
years. Kant is as yet a sealed book, and
what he has been understood to teach, is
exactly what he intended to eradicate.</p>

<p class='c006'>My writings are neither to explain Kant,
nor to be explained by his; they must
stand by themselves, and Kant must not be
counted in the game at all. My object is—let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>me say it frankly—not to correct or
amplify such philosophical reflections as
may be current, be they called anti-Kant
or Kant, but to totally eradicate
them, and to effect a complete revolution
in the mode of thinking regarding these
subjects, so that hereafter the Object will
be posited and determined by Knowledge
(Reason), and not <i>vice versa</i>; and this
seriously, not merely in words.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let no one object: “If this system is
true, certain axioms cannot be upheld,”
for I do not intend that anything should
be upheld which this system refutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again: “I do not understand this book,”
is to me a very uninteresting and insignificant
confession. No one can and shall
understand my writings, without having
studied them; for they do not contain a
lesson heretofore taught, but something—since
Kant has not been understood—altogether
new to the age.</p>

<p class='c006'>Censure without argument tells me
simply that my doctrine does not please;
and this confession is again very unimportant;
for the question is not at all,
whether it pleases you or not, but whether
it has been proven. In the present sketch
I write only for those, in whom there
still dwells an inner sense of love for
truth; who still value science and conviction,
and who are impelled by a lively
zeal to seek truth. With those, who, by
long spiritual slavery, have lost with the
faith in their own conviction their faith
in the conviction of others; who consider
it folly if anybody attempts to seek truth
for himself; who see nothing in science
but a comfortable mode of subsistence;
who are horrified at every proposition
to enlarge its boundaries involving as
a new labor, and who consider no means
disgraceful by which they can hope to suppress
him who makes such a proposition,—with
those I have nothing to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>I should be sorry if <i>they</i> understood me.
Hitherto this wish of mine has been realized;
and I hope, even now, that these
present lines will so confuse them that they
can perceive nothing more in them than
mere words, while that which represents
their mind is torn hither and thither by
their ill-concealed rage.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>INTRODUCTION.</h4>
<p class='c005'>I. Attend to thyself; turn <i>thine</i> eye away
from all that surrounds thee and into <i>thine</i>
own inner self! Such is the first task imposed
upon the student by Philosophy.
We speak of nothing that is without thee,
but merely of thyself.</p>

<p class='c006'>The slightest self-observation must show
every one a remarkable difference between
the various immediate conditions of his
consciousness, which we may also call
representations. For some of them appear
altogether dependent upon our freedom,
and we cannot possibly believe that there
is without us anything corresponding to
them. Our imagination, our will, appears
to us as free. Others, however, we refer to
a Truth as their model, which is held to be
firmly fixed, independent of us; and in
determining such representations, we find
ourselves conditioned by the necessity of
their harmony with this Truth. In the
knowledge of them we do not consider
ourselves free, as far as their contents are
concerned. In short: while some of our
representations are accompanied by the
feeling of freedom, others are accompanied
by the feeling of necessity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reasonably the question cannot arise—why
are the representations dependent
upon our freedom determined in precisely
this manner, and not otherwise? For in
supposing them to be dependent upon our
freedom, all application of the conception
of a ground is rejected; they are thus, because
I so fashioned them, and if I had
fashioned them differently, they would be
otherwise.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it is certainly a question worthy of
reflection—what is the ground of the system
of those representations which are accompanied
by the feeling of necessity and
of that feeling of necessity itself? To
answer this question is the object of philosophy;
and, in my opinion, nothing is
philosophy but the Science which solves
this problem. The system of those representations,
which are accompanied by the
feeling of necessity, is also called <i>Experience</i>—internal
as well as external experience.
Philosophy, therefore, to say the
same thing in other words, has to find the
ground of all Experience.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Only three objections can be raised
against this. Somebody might deny that
representations, accompanied by the feeling
of necessity, and referred to a Truth
determined without any action of ours, do
ever occur in our consciousness. Such a
person would either deny his own knowledge,
or be altogether differently constructed
from other men; in which latter
case his denial would be of no concern to
us. Or somebody might say: the question
is completely unanswerable, we are in irremovable
ignorance concerning it, and
must remain so. To enter into argument
with such a person is altogether superfluous.
The best reply he can receive is an
actual answer to the question, and then
all he can do is to examine our answer,
and tell us why and in what matters it does
not appear satisfactory to him. Finally,
somebody might quarrel about the designation,
and assert: “Philosophy is something
else than what you have stated
above, or at least something else besides.”
It might be easily shown to such a one,
that scholars have at all times designated
exactly what we have just stated to be
Philosophy, and that whatever else he
might assert to be Philosophy, has already
another name, and that if this word signifies
anything at all, it must mean exactly
this Science. But as we are not inclined
to enter upon any dispute about words,
we, for our part, have already given up
the name of Philosophy, and have called
the Science which has the solution of this
problem for its object, the <i>Science of
Knowledge</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. Only when speaking of something,
which we consider accidental, i. e. which
we suppose might also have been otherwise,
though it was not determined by freedom,
can we ask for its ground; and by
this very asking for its ground does it become
accidental to the questioner. To
find the ground of anything accidental
means, to find something else, from the
determinedness of which it can be seen
why the accidental, amongst the various
conditions it might have assumed, assumed
precisely the one it did. The ground lies—by
the very thinking of a ground—beyond
its Grounded, and both are, in so far
as they are Ground and Grounded, opposed
to each other, related to each other, and
thus the latter is explained from the former.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now Philosophy is to discover the
ground of all experience; hence its object
lies necessarily <i>beyond all Experience</i>.
This sentence applies to all Philosophy,
and has been so applied always heretofore,
if we except these latter days of Kant’s
misconstruers and their facts of consciousness,
i. e. of inner experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>No objection can be raised to this paragraph;
for the premise of our conclusion
is a mere analysis of the above-stated conception
of Philosophy, and from the premise
the conclusion is drawn. If somebody
should wish to remind us that the
conception of a ground must be differently
explained, we can, to be sure, not prevent
him from forming another conception of
it, if he so chooses; but we declare, on
the strength of our good right, that <i>we</i>, in
the above description of Philosophy, wish
to have nothing else understood by that
word. Hence, if it is not to be so understood,
the possibility of Philosophy, as we
have described it, must be altogether denied,
and such a denial we have replied to
in our first section.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The finite intelligence has nothing
beyond experience; experience contains
the whole substance of its thinking. The
philosopher stands necessarily under the
same conditions, and hence it seems impossible
that he can elevate himself beyond
experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>But he can abstract; i. e. he can separate
by the freedom of thinking what in experience
is united. In Experience, <i>the Thing</i>—that
which is to be determined in itself
independent of our freedom, and in accordance
with which our knowledge is to
shape itself—and the Intelligence—which
is to obtain a knowledge of it—are inseparably
united. The philosopher may
abstract from both, and if he does, he has
abstracted from Experience and elevated
himself above it. If he abstracts from the
first, he retains an intelligence <i>in itself</i>,
i. e. abstracted from its relation to experience;
if he abstract from the latter, he retains
the Thing <i>in itself</i>, i. e. abstracted
from the fact that it occurs in experience;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>and thus retains the Intelligence in itself,
or the “Thing in itself,” as the
explanatory ground of Experience. The
former mode of proceeding is called <i>Idealism</i>,
the latter <i>Dogmatism</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Only these two philosophical systems—and
of that these remarks should convince
everybody—are possible. According to
the first system the representations, which
are accompanied by the feeling of necessity,
are productions of the Intelligence,
which must be presupposed in their explanation;
according to the latter system
they are the productions of a thing in itself
which must be presupposed to explain
them. If anybody desired to deny this,
he would have to prove that there is still
another way to go beyond experience than
the one by means of abstraction, or that
the consciousness of experience contains
more than the two components just mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now in regard to the first, it will appear
below, it is true, that what we have here
called Intelligence does, indeed, occur in
consciousness under another name, and
hence is not altogether produced by abstraction;
but it will at the same time be
shown that the consciousness of it is conditioned
by an abstraction, which, however,
occurs naturally to mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>We do not at all deny that it is possible
to compose a whole system from fragments
of these incongruous systems, and that
this illogical labor has often been undertaken;
but we do deny that more than
these two systems are possible in a logical
course of proceeding.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. Between the object—(we shall call
the explanatory ground of experience,
which a philosophy asserts, the <i>object of
that philosophy</i>, since it appears to be only
through and for such philosophy)—between
the object of <i>Idealism</i> and that of
<i>Dogmatism</i> there is a remarkable distinction
in regard to their relation to consciousness
generally. All whereof I am conscious
is called object of consciousness.
There are three ways in which the object
can be related to consciousness. Either
it appears to have been produced by the
representation, or as existing without any
action of ours; and in the latter case, as
either also determined in regard to its
qualitativeness, or as existing merely in
regard to its existence, while determinable
in regard to its qualitativeness by the free
intelligence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first relation applies merely to an
imaginary object; the second merely to an
object of Experience; the third applies
only to an object, which we shall at once
proceed to describe.</p>

<p class='c006'>I can determine myself by freedom to
think, for instance, the Thing in itself of
the Dogmatists. Now if I am to abstract
from the thought and look simply upon
myself, I myself become the object of a
particular representation. That I appear to
myself as determined in precisely this
manner, and none other, e. g. as thinking,
and as thinking of all possible thoughts—precisely
this Thing in itself, is to depend
exclusively upon my own freedom of self-determination;
I have made myself such a
particular object out of my own free will.
I have not made <i>myself</i>; on the contrary, I
am forced to think myself in advance as
determinable through this self-determination.
Hence I am myself my own object,
the determinateness of which, under certain
conditions, depends altogether upon
the intelligence, but the existence of which
must always be presupposed. Now this
very “I” is the object of Idealism. The
object of this system does not occur actually
as something real in consciousness, not
as a <i>Thing in itself</i>—for then Idealism
would cease to be what it is, and become
Dogmatism—but as <i>“I” in itself</i>; not as
an object of Experience—for it is not determined,
but is exclusively determinable
through my freedom, and without this determination
it would be nothing, and is
really not at all—but as something beyond
all Experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>The object of Dogmatism, on the contrary,
belongs to the objects of the first
class, which are produced solely by free
Thinking. The Thing in itself is a mere
invention, and has no reality at all. It
does not occur in Experience, for the system
of Experience is nothing else than
Thinking accompanied by the feeling of
necessity, and can not even be said to be
anything else by the dogmatist, who, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>every philosopher, has to explain its cause.
True, the dogmatist wants to obtain reality
for it through the necessity of thinking
it as ground of all experience, and
would succeed, if he could prove that experience
can be, and can be explained only
by means of it. But this is the very thing
in dispute, and he cannot presuppose what
must first be proven.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence the object of Idealism has this
advantage over the object of Dogmatism,
that it is not to be deduced as the explanatory
ground of Experience—which would
be a contradiction, and change this system
itself into a part of Experience—but that
it is, nevertheless, to be pointed out as a
part of consciousness; whereas, the object
of Dogmatism can pass for nothing but a
mere invention, which obtains validity
only through the success of the system.</p>

<p class='c006'>This we have said merely to promote a
clearer insight into the distinction between
the two systems, but not to draw from it
conclusions against the latter system.
That the object of every philosophy, as
explanatory ground of Experience, must
lie beyond all experience, is required by
the very nature of Philosophy, and is far
from being derogatory to a system. But
we have as yet discovered no reasons why
that object should also occur in a particular
manner within consciousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>If anybody should not be able to convince
himself of the truth of what we have just
said, this would not make his conviction
of the truth of the whole system an impossibility,
since what we have just said was
only intended as a passing remark. Still
in conformity to our plan we will also here
take possible objections into consideration.
Somebody might deny the asserted immediate
self-consciousness in a free act of
the mind. Such a one we should refer to
the conditions stated above. This self-consciousness
does not obtrude itself upon
us, and comes not of its own accord; it is
necessary first to act free, and next to abstract
from the object, and attend to one’s
self. Nobody can be forced to do this,
and though he may say he has done it, it
is impossible to say whether he has done
it correctly. In one word, this consciousness
cannot be proven to any one, but
everybody must freely produce it within
himself. Against the second assertion,
that the “Thing in itself” is a mere invention,
an objection could only be raised,
because it were misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c006'>V. Neither of these two systems can directly
refute the other; for their dispute is
a dispute about the first principle; each
system—if you only admit its first axiom—proves
the other one wrong; each denies
all to the opposite, and these two systems
have no point in common from which they
might bring about a mutual understanding
and reconciliation. Though they may agree
on the words of a sentence, they will surely
attach a different meaning to the words.</p>

<p class='c006'>(Hence the reason why Kant has not
been understood and why the Science of
Knowledge can find no friends. The systems
of Kant and of the Science of Knowledge
are <i>idealistic</i>—not in the general indefinite,
but in the just described definite
sense of the word; but the modern philosophers
are all of them dogmatists, and
are firmly resolved to remain so. Kant
was merely tolerated, because it was possible
to make a dogmatist out of him; but
the Science of Knowledge, which cannot
be thus construed, is insupportable to these
wise men. The rapid extension of Kant’s
philosophy—when it was thus misunderstood—is
not a proof of the profundity,
but rather of the shallowness of the age.
For in this shape it is the most wonderful
abortion ever created by human imagination,
and it does little honor to its defenders
that they do not perceive this. It
can also be shown that this philosophy was
accepted so greedily only because people
thought it would put a stop to all serious
speculation, and continue the era of shallow
Empiricism.)</p>

<p class='c006'>First. Idealism cannot refute Dogmatism.
True, the former system has the advantage,
as we have already said, of being
enabled to point out its explanatory ground
of all experience—the free acting intelligence—as
a fact of consciousness. This
fact the dogmatist must also admit, for
otherwise he would render himself incapable
of maintaining the argument with his
opponent; but he at the same time, by a correct
conclusion from his principle, changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>this explanatory ground into a deception
and appearance, and thus renders it incapable
of being the explanatory ground of
anything else, since it cannot maintain its
own existence in its own philosophy. According
to the Dogmatist, all phenomena
of our consciousness are productions of a
<i>Thing in itself</i>, even our pretended determinations
by freedom, and the belief that
we are free. This belief is produced by
the effect of the Thing upon ourselves, and
the determinations, which we deduced from
freedom, are also produced by it. The only
difference is, that we are not aware of it in
these cases, and hence ascribe it to no
cause, i. e. to our freedom. Every logical
dogmatist is necessarily a Fatalist; he does
not deny the fact of consciousness, that we
consider ourselves free—for this would be
against reason;—but he proves from his
principle that this is a false view. He denies
the independence of the <i>Ego</i>, which is
the basis of the Idealist, <i>in toto</i>, makes it
merely a production of the Thing, an accidence
of the World; and hence the logical
dogmatist is necessarily also materialist.
He can only be refuted from the postulate
of the freedom and independence of the
<i>Ego</i>; but this is precisely what he denies.
Neither can the dogmatist refute the Idealist.</p>

<p class='c006'>The principle of the former, the Thing
in itself, is nothing, and has no reality, as
its defenders themselves must admit, except
that which it is to receive from the
fact that experience can only be explained
by it. But this proof the Idealist annihilates
by explaining experience in another
manner, hence by denying precisely what
dogmatism assumes. Thus the Thing in
itself becomes a complete Chimera; there
is no further reason why it should be assumed;
and with it the whole edifice of
dogmatism tumbles down.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what we have just stated, is moreover
evident the complete irreconcilability
of both systems; since the <i>results</i> of the
one destroy those of the other. Wherever
their union has been attempted the members
would not fit together, and somewhere
an immense gulf appeared which could not
be spanned.</p>

<p class='c006'>If any one were to deny this he would
have to prove the possibility of such a
union—of a union which consists in an
everlasting composition of Matter and
Spirit, or, which is the same, of Necessity
and Liberty.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now since, as far as we can see at present,
both systems appear to have the same
speculative value, but since both cannot
stand together, nor yet either convince the
other, it occurs as a very interesting question:
What can possibly tempt persons who
comprehend this—and to comprehend it is
so very easy a matter—to prefer the one
over the other; and why skepticism, as the
total renunciation of an answer to this
problem, does not become universal?</p>

<p class='c006'>The dispute between the Idealist and the
Dogmatist is, in reality, the question,
whether the independence of the <i>Ego</i> is
to be sacrificed to that of the Thing, or <i>vice
versa</i>? What, then, is it, which induces
sensible men to decide in favor of the one
or the other?</p>

<p class='c006'>The philosopher discovers from this point
of view—in which he must necessarily place
himself, if he wants to pass for a philosopher,
and which, in the progress of Thinking,
every man necessarily occupies sooner
or later,—nothing farther <i>than that he
is forced to represent to himself</i> both:
that he is free, and that there are determined
things outside of him. But it
is impossible for man to stop at this
thought; the thought of a representation
is but a half-thought, a broken off fragment
of a thought; something must be
thought and added to it, as corresponding
with the representation independent of it.
In other words: the representation cannot
exist alone by itself, it is only something
in connection with something else, and in
itself it is nothing. This necessity of thinking
it is, which forces one from that point
of view to the question: What is the ground
of the representations? or, which is exactly
the same, What is that which corresponds
with them?</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the <i>representation</i> of the independence
of the <i>Ego</i> and that of the Thing can
very well exist together; but not the independence
<i>itself</i> of both. Only one can be
the first, the beginning, the independent;
the second, by the very fact of being the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>second, becomes necessarily dependent
upon the first, with which it is to be connected—now,
which of the two is to be
made the first? Reason furnishes no ground
for a decision; since the question concerns
not the connecting of one link with another,
but the commencement of the first
link, which as an absolute first act is altogether
conditional upon the freedom of
Thinking. Hence the decision is arbitrary;
and since this arbitrariness is nevertheless
to have a cause, the decision is dependent
upon <i>inclination</i> and <i>interest</i>.
The last ground, therefore, of the difference
between the Dogmatist and the Idealist
is the difference of their interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>The highest interest, and hence the
ground of all other interest, is that which
we feel <i>for ourselves</i>. Thus with the Philosopher.
Not to lose his Self in his argumentation,
but to retain and assert it, this
is the interest which unconsciously guides
all his Thinking. Now, there are two
grades of mankind; and in the progress
of our race, before the last grade has been
universally attained, two chief kinds of
men. The one kind is composed of those
who have not yet elevated themselves to
the full feeling of their freedom and absolute
independence, who are merely conscious
of themselves in the representation
of outward things. These men have only
a desultory consciousness, linked together
with the outward objects, and put together
out of their manifoldness. They receive a
picture of their Self only from the Things,
as from a mirror; for their own sake they
cannot renounce their faith in the independence
of those things, since they exist
only together with these things. Whatever
they are they have become through
the outer World. Whosoever is only a
production of the Things will never view
himself in any other manner; and he is
perfectly correct, so long as he speaks
merely for himself and for those like him.
The principle of the dogmatist is: Faith
in the things, for their own sake; hence,
mediated Faith in their own desultory self,
as simply the result of the Things.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whosoever becomes conscious of his
self-existence and independence from all
outward things—and this men can only become
by making something of themselves,
through their own Self, independently of
all outward things—needs no longer the
Things as supports of his Self, and cannot
use them, because they annihilate his independence
and turn it into an empty appearance.
The <i>Ego</i> which he possesses, and
which interests him, destroys that Faith in
the Things; he believes in his independence,
from inclination, and seizes it with
affection. His Faith in himself is <i>immediate</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this interest the various passions
are explicable, which mix generally with
the defence of these philosophical systems.
The dogmatist is in danger of losing his
Self when his system is attacked; and yet
he is not armed against this attack, because
there is something within him which takes
part with the aggressor; hence, he defends
himself with bitterness and heat. The idealist,
on the contrary, cannot well refrain
from looking down upon his opponent with
a certain carelessness, since the latter can
tell him nothing which he has not known
long ago and has cast away as useless. The
dogmatist gets angry, misconstrues, and
would persecute, if he had the power; the
idealist is cold and in danger of ridiculing
his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence, what philosophy a man chooses
depends entirely upon what kind of man
he is; for a philosophical system is not a
piece of dead household furniture, which
you may use or not use, but is animated
by the soul of the man who has it. Men
of a naturally weak-minded character, or
who have become weak-minded and crooked
through intellectual slavery, scholarly luxury
and vanity, will never elevate themselves
to idealism.</p>

<p class='c006'>You can show the dogmatist the insufficiency
and inconsequence of his system, of
which we shall speak directly; you can
confuse and terrify him from all sides; but
you cannot <i>convince</i> him, because he is unable
to listen to and examine with calmness
what he cannot tolerate. If Idealism
should prove to be the only real Philosophy,
it will also appear that a man must be born
a philosopher, be educated to be one, and
educate himself to be one; but that no
human art (no external force) can make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>philosopher out of him. Hence, this Science
expects few proselytes from men who
have already formed their character; if
our Philosophy has any hopes at all, it entertains
them rather from the young generation,
the natural vigor of which has not
yet been submerged in the weak-mindedness
of the age.</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. But dogmatism is totally incapable
of explaining what it should explain, and
this is decisive in regard to its insufficiency.
It is to explain the representation of
things, and proposes to explain them as an
effect of the Things. Now, the dogmatist
cannot deny what immediate consciousness
asserts of this representation. What,
then, does it assert thereof? It is not my
purpose here to put in a conception what
can only be gathered in immediate contemplation,
nor to exhaust that which forms a
great portion of the Science of Knowledge.
I will merely recall to memory what every
one, who has but firmly looked within himself,
must long since have discovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Intelligence, as such, <i>sees itself</i>, and
this seeing of its self is immediately connected
with all that appertains to the Intelligence;
and in this immediate uniting of
<i>Being</i> and <i>Seeing</i> the nature of the Intelligence
consists. Whatever is in the Intelligence,
whatever the Intelligence is
itself, the Intelligence is <i>for itself</i>, and
only in so far as it is this <i>for itself</i> is it
this, as Intelligence.</p>

<p class='c006'>I think this or that object! Now what
does this mean, and how do I appear to
myself in this Thinking? Not otherwise
than thus: I produce certain conditions
within myself, if the object is a mere invention;
but if the objects are real and
exist without my invention, I simply contemplate,
as a spectator, the production of
those conditions within me. They are
within me only in so far as I contemplate
them; my contemplation and their Being
are inseparably united.</p>

<p class='c006'>A Thing, on the contrary, is to be this
or that; but as soon as the question is put:
<i>For whom</i> is it this? Nobody, who but
comprehends the word, will reply: For
itself! But he will have to add the
thought of an Intelligence, <i>for</i> which the
Thing is to be; while, on the contrary, the
Intelligence is self-sufficient and requires
no additional thought. By thinking it as
the Intelligence you include already that
for which it is to be. Hence, there is in
the Intelligence, to express myself figuratively,
a twofold—Being and Seeing, the
Real and the Ideal; and in the inseparability
of this twofold the nature of the Intelligence
consists, while the Thing is simply
a unit—the Real. Hence Intelligence and
Thing are directly opposed to each other;
they move in two worlds, between which
there is no bridge.</p>

<p class='c006'>The nature of the Intelligence and its
particular determinations Dogmatism endeavors
to explain by the principle of
Causality; the Intelligence is to be a production,
the second link in a series.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the principle of causality applies to
a <i>real</i> series, and not to a double one. The
power of the cause goes over into an Other
opposed to it, and produces therein a Being,
and nothing further; a Being for a
possible outside Intelligence, but not for
the thing itself. You may give this Other
even a mechanical power, and it will transfer
the received impression to the next
link, and thus the movement proceeding
from the first may be transferred through
as long a series as you choose to make;
but nowhere will you find a link which reacts
back upon itself. Or give the Other
the highest quality which you can give a
thing—Sensibility—whereby it will follow
the laws of its own inner nature, and not
the law given to it by the cause—and it
will, to be sure, react upon the outward
cause; but it will, nevertheless, remain a
mere simple Being, a Being for a possible
intelligence outside of it. The Intelligence
you will not get, unless you add it in thinking
as the primary and absolute, the connection
of which, with this your <i>independent</i>
Being, you will find it very difficult to
explain.</p>

<p class='c006'>The series is and remains a simple one;
and you have not at all explained what was
to be explained. You were to prove the
connection between Being and Representation;
but this you do not, nor can you
do it; for your principle contains merely
the ground of a Being, and not of a Representation,
totally opposed to Being. You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>take an immense leap into a world, totally
removed from your principle. This leap
they seek to hide in various ways. Rigorously—and
this is the course of consistent
dogmatism, which thus becomes
materialism;—the soul is to them no Thing
at all, and indeed nothing at all, but merely
a production, the result of the reciprocal action
of Things amongst themselves. But
this reciprocal action produces merely a
change in the Things, and by no means
anything apart from the Things, unless you
add an observing intelligence. The similes
which they adduce to make their system
comprehensible, for instance, that of the
harmony resulting from sounds of different
instruments, make its irrationality only
more apparent. For the harmony is not in
the instruments, but merely in the mind of
the hearer, who combines within himself
the manifold into One; and unless you
have such a hearer there is no harmony at
all.</p>

<p class='c006'>But who can prevent Dogmatism from
assuming the Soul as one of the Things,
<i>per se</i>? The soul would thus belong to
what it has postulated for the solution of
its problem, and, indeed, would thereby
be made the category of cause and effect
applicable to the Soul and the Things—materialism
only permitting a reciprocal
action of the Things amongst themselves—and
thoughts might now be produced. To
make the Unthinkable thinkable, Dogmatism
has, indeed, attempted to presuppose
Thing or the Soul, or both, in such a manner,
that the effect of the Thing was to
produce a representation. The Thing, as
influencing the Soul, is to be such, as to
make its influences representations; <span class='sc'>God</span>,
for instance, in Berkley’s system, was such
a thing. (His system is dogmatic, not
idealistic.) But this does not better matters;
we understand only mechanical
effects, and it is impossible for us to understand
any other kind of effects. Hence,
that presupposition contains merely words,
but there is no sense in it. Or the soul
is to be of such a nature that every effect
upon the Soul turns into a representation.
But this also we find it impossible to
understand.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this manner Dogmatism proceeds
everywhere, whatever phase it may assume.
In the immense gulf, which in that system
remains always open between Things and
Representations, it places a few empty
words instead of an explanation, which
words may certainly be committed to memory,
but in saying which nobody has ever
yet thought, nor ever will think, anything.
For whenever one attempts to think the
manner in which is accomplished what
Dogmatism asserts to be accomplished, the
whole idea vanishes into empty foam.
Hence Dogmatism can only repeat its
principle, and repeat it in different forms;
can only assert and re-assert the same
thing; but it cannot proceed from what it
asserts to what is to be explained, nor ever
deduce the one from the other. But in
this deduction Philosophy consists. Hence
Dogmatism, even when viewed from a
speculative stand-point, is no Philosophy
at all, but merely an impotent assertion.
Idealism is the only possible remaining
Philosophy. What we have here said can
meet with no objection; but it may well
meet with incapability of understanding
it. That all influences are of a mechanical
nature, and that no mechanism can produce
a representation, nobody will deny,
who but understands the words. But this
is the very difficulty. It requires a certain
degree of independence and freedom of
spirit to comprehend the nature of the intelligence,
which we have described, and
upon which our whole refutation of Dogmatism
is founded. Many persons have
not advanced further with their Thinking
than to comprehend the simple chain of natural
mechanism, and very naturally, therefore,
the Representation, if they choose
to think it at all, belongs, in their eyes, to
the same chain of which alone they have
any knowledge. The Representation thus
becomes to them a sort of Thing of which
we have divers examples in some of the
most celebrated philosophical writers. For
such persons Dogmatism is sufficient: for
them there is no gulf, since the opposite does
not exist for them at all. Hence you cannot
convince the Dogmatist by the proof
just stated, however clear it may be, for you
cannot bring the proof to his knowledge,
since he lacks the power to comprehend it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Moreover, the manner in which Dogmatism
is treated here, is opposed to the mild
way of thinking which characterizes our
age, and which, though it has been extensively
accepted in all ages, has never been
converted to an express principle except in
ours; i. e. that philosophers must not be
so strict in their logic; in philosophy one
should not be so particular as, for instance,
in Mathematics. If persons of this mode
of thinking see but a few links of the
chain and the rule, according to which
conclusions are drawn, they at once fill up
the remaining part through their imagination,
never investigating further of what
they may consist. If, for instance, an
Alexander Von Ioch tells them: “All
things are determined by natural necessity;
now our representations depend
upon the condition of Things, and our
will depends upon our representations:
hence all our will is determined by natural
necessity, and our opinion of a free will is
mere deception!”—then these people think
it mightily comprehensible and clear, although
there is no sense in it; and they go
away convinced and satisfied at the stringency
of this his demonstration.</p>

<p class='c006'>I must call to mind, that the Science of
Knowledge does not proceed from this
mild way of thinking, nor calculate upon
it. If only a single link in the long chain
it has to draw does not fit closely to the
following, this Science does not pretend to
have established anything.</p>

<p class='c006'>VII. Idealism, as we have said above,
explains the determinations of consciousness
from the activity of the Intelligence,
which, in its view, is only active and absolute,
not passive; since it is postulated
as the first and highest, preceded by nothing,
which might explain its passivity.
From the same reason actual <i>Existence</i> cannot
well be ascribed to the Intelligence,
since such Existence is the result of reciprocal
causality, but there is nothing
wherewith the Intelligence might be placed
in reciprocal causality. From the view of
Idealism, the Intelligence is a <i>Doing</i>, and
absolutely nothing else; it is even wrong
to call it <i>an Active</i>, since this expression
points to something existing, in which the
activity is inherent.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to assume anything of this kind is
against the principle of Idealism, which
proposes to deduce all other things from
the Intelligence. Now certain <i>determined</i>
representations—as, for instance, of a
world, of a material world in space, existing
without any work of our own—are to
be deduced from the action of the Intelligence;
but you cannot deduce anything
determined from an undetermined; the
form of all deductions, the category of
ground and sequence, is not applicable
here. Hence the action of the Intelligence,
which is made the ground, must be a <i>determined</i>
action, and since the action of
the Intelligence itself is the highest ground
of explanation, that action must be so determined
<i>by the Intelligence itself</i>, and not
by anything foreign to it. Hence the presupposition
of Idealism will be this: the Intelligence
acts, but by its very essence it
can only act in a certain manner. If this
necessary manner of its action is considered
apart from the action, it may properly be
called Laws of Action. Hence, there are
necessary laws of the Intelligence.</p>

<p class='c006'>This explains also, at the same time, the
feeling of necessity which accompanies
the determined representations; the Intelligence
experiences in those cases, not an
impression from without, but feels in its
action the limits of its own Essence. In
so far as Idealism makes this only reasonable
and really explanatory presupposition
of necessary laws of the Intelligence, it is
called <i>Critical</i> or <i>Transcendental Idealism</i>.
A transcendent Idealism would be a system
which were to undertake a deduction
of determined representations from the
free and perfectly lawless action of the
Intelligence: an altogether contradictory
presupposition, since, as we have said
above, the category of ground and sequence
is not applicable in that case.</p>

<p class='c006'>The laws of action of the Intelligence,
as sure as they are to be founded in the
one nature of the Intelligence, constitute
in themselves a system; that is to say, the
fact that the Intelligence acts in this particular
manner under this particular condition
<i>is</i> explainable, and explainable because
under a condition it has always a
determined mode of action, which again is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>explainable from <i>one</i> highest fundamental
law. In the course of its action the Intelligence
gives itself its own laws; and this
legislation itself is done by virtue of a
higher necessary action or Representation.
For instance: the law of Causality is not a
first original law, but only one of the many
modes of combining the manifold, and to
be deduced from the fundamental law of
this combination; this law of combining
the manifold is again, like the manifold
itself, to be deduced from higher laws.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence, even Critical Idealism can proceed
in a twofold manner. Either it deduces
this system of necessary modes of
action, and together with it the objective
representations arising therefrom, really
from the fundamental laws of the Intelligence,
and thus causes gradually to arise
under the very eyes of the reader or hearer
the whole extent of our representations; or
it gathers these laws—perhaps as they are
already immediately applied to objects;
hence, in a lower condition, and then they
are called categories—gathers these laws
somewhere, and now asserts, that the objects
are determined and regulated by
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>I ask the critic who follows the last-mentioned
method, and who does not deduce
the assumed laws of the Intelligence
from the Essence of the Intelligence,
where he gets the material knowledge of
these laws, the knowledge that they are
just these very same laws; for instance,
that of Substantiality or Causality? For
I do not want to trouble him yet with the
question, how he knows that they are mere
immanent laws of the Intelligence. They
are the laws which are immediately applied
to objects, and he can only have obtained
them by abstraction from these objects,
i. e. from Experience. It is of no avail if
he takes them, by a roundabout way, from
logic, for logic is to him only the result
of abstraction from the objects, and hence
he would do indirectly, what directly might
appear too clearly in its true nature.
Hence he can prove by nothing that his
postulated Laws of Thinking are really
Laws of Thinking, are really nothing but
immanent laws of the Intelligence. The
Dogmatist asserts in opposition, that they
are not, but that they are general qualities
of Things, founded on the nature of
Things, and there is no reason why we
should place more faith in the unproved
assertion of the one than in the unproved
assertion of the other. This course of proceeding,
indeed, furnishes no understanding
that and why the Intelligence should act
just in this particular manner. To produce
such an understanding, it would be necessary
to premise something which can only
appertain to the Intelligence, and from
those premises to deduce before our eyes
the laws of Thinking.</p>

<p class='c006'>By such a course of proceeding it is
above all incomprehensible how the object
itself is obtained; for although you may
admit the unproved postulates of the critic,
they explain nothing further than the
<i>qualities</i> and <i>relations</i> of the Thing: (that
it is, for instance, in space, manifested in
time, with accidences which must be referred
to a substance, &amp;c.) But whence
that which has these relations and qualities?
whence then the substance which
is clothed in these forms? This substance
Dogmatism takes refuge in, and you have
but increased the evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>We know very well: the Thing arises only
from an act done in accordance with these
laws, and is, indeed, nothing else than
<i>all these relations gathered together by the
power of imagination</i>; and all these relations
together are the Thing. The Object
is the original Synthesis of all these conceptions.
Form and Substance are not
separates; the whole formness is the substance,
and only in the analysis do we arrive
at separate forms.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this the critic, who follows the above
method, can only assert, and it is even a
secret whence he knows it, if he does know
it. Until you cause the whole Thing to
arise before the eyes of the thinker, you
have not pursued Dogmatism into its last
hiding places. But this is only possible
by letting the Intelligence act in its whole,
and not in its partial, lawfulness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence, an Idealism of this character is
unproven and unprovable. Against Dogmatism
it has no other weapon than the
assertion that it is in the right; and against
the more perfected criticism no other weapon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>than impotent anger, and the assurance
that you can go no further than itself
goes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally a system of this character puts
forth only those laws, according to which
the objects of external experience are determined.
But these constitute by far the
smallest portion of the laws of the Intelligence.
Hence, on the field of Practical Reason
and of Reflective Judgment, this half
criticism, lacking the insight into the
whole procedure of reason, gropes about
as in total darkness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The method of complete transcendental
Idealism, which the Science of Knowledge
pursues, I have explained once before in
my Essay, <i>On the conception of the Science
of Knowledge</i>. I cannot understand why
that Essay has not been understood; but
suffice it to say, that I am assured it has
not been understood. I am therefore compelled
to repeat what I have said, and to
recall to mind that everything depends
upon the correct understanding thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>This Idealism proceeds from a single
fundamental Law of Reason, which is immediately
shown as contained in consciousness.
This is done in the following
manner: The teacher of that Science requests
his reader or hearer to think freely
a certain conception. If he does so, he will
find himself forced to proceed in a particular
manner. Two things are to be distinguished
here: the act of Thinking, which is
required—the realization of which depends
upon each individual’s freedom,—and unless
he realizes it thus, he will not understand
anything which the Science of
Knowledge teaches; and the necessary
manner in which it alone can be realized,
which manner is grounded in the Essence
of the Intelligence, and does not depend
upon freedom; it is something <i>necessary</i>,
but which is only discovered in and together
with a free action; it is something
<i>discovered</i>, but the discovery of which depends
upon an act of freedom.</p>

<p class='c006'>So far as this goes, the teacher of Idealism
shows his assertion to be contained in
immediate consciousness. But that this
necessary manner is the fundamental law
of all reason, that from it the whole system
of our necessary representations, not
only of a world and the determinedness and
relations of objects, but also of ourselves,
as free and practical beings acting under
laws, can be deduced. All this is a mere
presupposition, which can only be proven
by the actual deduction, which deduction is
therefore the real business of the teacher.</p>

<p class='c006'>In realizing this deduction, he proceeds
as follows: <i>He shows that the first fundamental
law which was discovered in immediate
consciousness, is not possible, unless
a second action is combined with it, which
again is not possible without a third action;
and so on, until the conditions of the First
are completely exhausted, and itself is now
made perfectly comprehensible in its possibility</i>.
The teacher’s method is a continual
progression from the conditioned to
the condition. The condition becomes
again conditioned, and its condition is next
to be discovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the presupposition of Idealism is correct,
and if no errors have been made in the
deduction, the last result, as containing all
the conditions of the first act, must contain
the system of all necessary representations,
or the total experience;—a comparison,
however, which is not instituted in
Philosophy itself, but only after that science
has finished its work.</p>

<p class='c006'>For Idealism has not kept this experience
in sight, as the preknown object and
result, which it should arrive at; in its
course of proceeding it knows nothing at
all of experience, and does not look upon
it; it proceeds from its starting point according
to its rules, careless as to what the
result of its investigations might turn out
to be. The right angle, from which it has
to draw its straight line, is given to it; is
there any need of another point to which
the line should be drawn? Surely not; for
all the points of its line are already given
to it with the angle. A certain number is
given to you. You suppose that it is
the product of certain factors. All you
have to do is to search for the product of
these factors according to the well-known
rules. Whether that product will agree
with the given number, you will find out,
without any difficulty, as soon as you have
obtained it. The given number is the total
experience; those factors are: the part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>immediate consciousness which was discovered,
and the laws of Thinking; the
multiplication is the Philosophizing. Those
who advise you, while philosophizing,
also to keep an eye upon experience, advise
you to change the factors a little, and to
multiply falsely, so as to obtain by all
means corresponding numbers; a course of
proceeding as dishonest as it is shallow.
In so far as those final results of Idealism
are viewed as such, as consequences of our
reasoning, they are what is called the <i>a
priori</i> of the human mind; and in so far
as they are viewed, also—if they should
agree with experience—as given in experience,
they are called <i>a posteriori</i>. Hence
the <i>a priori</i> and the <i>a posteriori</i> are, in a
true Philosophy, not two, but one and the
same, only viewed in two different ways,
and distinguished only by the manner in
which they are obtained. Philosophy anticipates
the whole experience, <i>thinks</i> it
only as necessary; and, in so far, Philosophy
is, in comparison with real experience,
<i>a priori</i>. The number is <i>a posteriori</i>, if regarded
as given; the same number is <i>a
priori</i>, if regarded as product of the factors.
Whosoever says otherwise knows
not what he talks about.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the results of a Philosophy do not
agree with experience, that Philosophy is
surely wrong; for it has not fulfilled its
promise of deducing the whole experience
from the necessary action of the intelligence.
In that case, either the presupposition
of transcendental Idealism is altogether
incorrect, or it has merely been incorrectly
treated in the particular representation
of that science. Now, since the
problem, to explain experience from its
ground, is a problem contained in human
reason, and as no rational man will admit
that human reason contains any problem
the solution of which is altogether impossible;
and since, moreover, there are
only two ways of solving it, the dogmatic
system (which, as we have shown, cannot
accomplish what it promises) and the Idealistic
system, every resolute Thinker will
always declare that the latter has been the
case; that the presupposition in itself is
correct enough, and that no failure in attempts
to represent it should deter men
from attempting it again until finally it
must succeed. The course of this Idealism
proceeds, as we have seen, from a fact
of consciousness—but which is only obtained
by a free act of Thinking—to the total
experience. Its peculiar ground is between
these two. It is not a fact of consciousness
and does not belong within the
sphere of experience; and, indeed, how
could it be called Philosophy if it did, since
Philosophy has to discover the ground of
experience, and since the ground lies, of
course, beyond the sequence. It is the
production of free Thinking, but proceeding
according to laws. This will be at once
clear, if we look a little closer at the fundamental
assertion of Idealism. It proves
that the Postulated is not possible without
a second, this not without a third, &amp;c., &amp;c.;
hence none of all its conditions is possible
alone and by itself, but each one is only
possible in its union with all the rest.
Hence, according to its own assertion, only
the Whole is found in consciousness, and
this Whole is the experience. You want
to obtain a better knowledge of it; hence
you must analyze it, not by blindly groping
about, but according to the fixed rule of
composition, so that it arises under your
eyes as a Whole. You are enabled to do
this because you have the power of abstraction;
because in free Thinking you can
certainly take hold of each single condition.
For consciousness contains not only
necessity of Representations, but also freedom
thereof; and this freedom again may
proceed according to rules. The Whole is
given to you from the point of view of necessary
consciousness; you find it just as
you find yourself. But the <i>composition</i> of
this Whole, the order of its arrangement,
is produced by freedom. Whosoever undertakes
this act of freedom, becomes conscious
of freedom, and thus establishes, as
it were, a new field within his consciousness;
whosoever does not undertake it, for
him this new field, dependent thereupon,
does not exist. The chemist composes a
body, a metal for instance, from its elements.
The common beholder sees the
metal well known to him; the chemist beholds,
moreover, the composition thereof
and the elements which it comprises. Do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>both now see different objects? I should
think not! Both see the same, only in a
different manner. The chemist’s sight is
<i>a priori</i>; he sees the separates; the ordinary
beholder’s sight is <i>a posteriori</i>; he
sees the Whole. The only distinction is
this: the chemist must first analyze the
Whole before he can compose it, because
he works upon an object of which he cannot
know the rule of composition before
he has analyzed it; while the philosopher
can compose without a foregoing analysis,
because he knows already the rule of his
object, of reason.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence the content of Philosophy can
claim no other reality than that of necessary
Thinking, on the condition that you
desire to think of the ground of Experience.
The Intelligence can only be
thought as active, and can only be thought
active in this particular manner! Such is
the assertion of Philosophy. And this
reality is perfectly sufficient for Philosophy,
since it is evident from the development of
that science that there is no other reality.</p>

<p class='c006'>This now described complete critical
Idealism, the Science of Knowledge intends
to establish. What I have said just now
contains the conception of that science, and
I shall listen to no objections which may
touch this conception, since no one can
know better than myself what I intend to
accomplish, and to demonstrate the impossibility
of a thing which is already realized,
is ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c006'>Objections, to be legitimate, should only
be raised against the elaboration of that
conception, and should only consider
whether it has fulfilled what it promised to
accomplish or not.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>ANALYTICAL AND CRITICAL ESSAY UPON THE ÆSTHETICS OF HEGEL. <br /> [Translated from the French of M. Ch. Bénard by J. A. Martling.]</h3>
<h4 class='c012'>ANALYSIS.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Having undertaken to translate into our
language the Æsthetics of Hegel, we hope
to render a new service to our readers, by
presenting, in an analysis at once cursory
and detailed the outline of the ideas which
form the basis of that vast work. The
thought of the author will appear shorn of
its rich developments; but it will be more
easy to seize the general spirit, the connection
of the various parts of the work, and
to appreciate their value. In order not to
mar the clearness of our work, we shall
abstain from mingling criticism with exposition;
but reserve for the conclusion a
general judgment upon this book, which
represents even to-day the state of the
philosophy of art in Germany.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work is divided into three parts;
the first treats <i>of the beautiful in art in
general</i>; <i>the second, of the general forms of
art in its historic development</i>; <i>the third
contains the system of the arts—the theory
of architecture, sculpture, painting, music,
and poetry</i>.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>PART I. <br /> OF THE BEAUTIFUL IN ART.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In an extended introduction, Hegel lays
the foundations of the science of the Beautiful:
he defines its object, demonstrates
its legitimacy, and indicates its method;
he then undertakes to determine the nature
and the end of art. Upon each of these
points let us endeavor to state, in a brief
manner, his thought, and, if it is necessary,
explain it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Æsthetics <i>is the science of the Beautiful</i>.
The Beautiful manifests itself in nature and
in art; but the variety and multiplicity
of forms under which beauty presents
itself in the real world, does not permit
their description and systematic classification.
The science of the Beautiful has
then as its principal object, art and its
works; it is the <i>philosophy of the fine arts</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Is art a proper object of science? No,
undoubtedly, if we consider it only as an
amusement or a frivolous relaxation. But
it has a nobler purpose. It will even be a
misconception of its true aim to regard it
simply as an auxiliary of morals and religion.
Although it often serves as interpreter
of moral and religious ideas, it preserves
its independence. Its proper object
is to reveal truth under sensuous forms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nor is it allowable to say that it produces
its effects by illusion. Appearance,
here, is truer than reality. The images
which it places under our eyes are more
ideal, more transparent, and also more durable
than the mobile and fugitive existences
of the real world. The world of art is
truer than that of nature and of history.</p>

<p class='c006'>Can science subject to its formulas the
free creations of the imagination? Art
and science, it is true, differ in their methods;
but imagination, also, has its laws;
though free, it has not the right to be lawless.
In art, nothing is arbitrary; its
ground <i>is the essence of things</i>; its form is
borrowed from the real world, and the
Beautiful is the accord, the harmony of
the two terms. Philosophy recognizes in
works of art the eternal content of its
meditations, the lofty conceptions of intelligence,
the passions of man, and the
motives of his volition. Philosophy does
not pretend to furnish prescriptions to art,
but is able to give useful advice; it follows
it in its procedures, it points out to
it the paths whereon it may go astray; it
alone can furnish to criticism a solid basis
and fixed principles.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the method to be followed, two
exclusive and opposite courses present
themselves. The one, <i>empiric</i> and <i>historic</i>,
seeks to draw from the study of the master-pieces
of art, the laws of criticism and the
principles of taste. The other, <i>rational</i>
and <i>a priori</i>, rises immediately to the idea
of the beautiful, and deduces from it certain
general rules. Aristotle and Plato represent
these two methods. The first
reaches only a narrow theory, incapable of
comprehending art in its universality; the
other, isolating itself on the heights of
metaphysics, knows not how to descend
therefrom to apply itself to particular arts,
and to appreciate their works. The true
method consists in the union of these two
methods, in their reconciliation and simultaneous
employment. To a positive acquaintance
with works of art, to the discrimination
and delicacy of taste necessary
to appreciate them, there should be
joined philosophic reflection, and the capacity
of seizing the Beautiful in itself,
and of comprehending its characteristics
and immutable laws.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is the nature of art? The answer
to this question can only be the philosophy
of art itself; and, furthermore, this again
can be perfectly understood only in its connection
with the other philosophic sciences.
One is here compelled to limit himself to
general reflections, and to the discussion
of received opinions.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, art is a product of human
activity, a creation of the mind. What
distinguishes it from science is this, that
it is the fruit of inspiration, not of reflection.
On this account it can not be learned
or transmitted; it is a gift of genius.
Nothing can possibly supply a lack of talent
in the arts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us guard ourselves meanwhile from
supposing that, like the blind forces of
nature, the artist does not know what he
does, that reflection has no part in his
works. There is, in the first place, in the
arts a technical part which must be learned,
and a skill which is acquired by practice.
Furthermore, the more elevated art becomes,
the more it demands an extended
and varied culture, a study of the objects
of nature, and a profound knowledge of
the human heart. This is eminently true
of the higher spheres of art, especially in
Poetry.</p>

<p class='c006'>If works of art are creations of the human
spirit, they are not on that account
inferior to those of nature. They are, it
is true, <i>living</i>, only in appearance; but the
aim of art is not to create living beings;
it seeks to offer to the spirit an image of
life clearer than the reality. In this, it
<i>surpasses</i> nature. There is also something
divine in man, and God derives no less
honor from the works of human intelligence
than from the works of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now what is the cause which incites man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to the production of such works? Is it a
caprice, a freak, or an earnest, fundamental
inclination of his nature?</p>

<p class='c006'>It is the same principle which causes
him to seek in science food for his mind,
in public life a theatre for his activity. In
science he endeavors to cognize the truth,
pure and unveiled; in art, truth appears
to him not in its pure form, but expressed
by images which strike his sense at the same
time that they speak to his intelligence.
This is the principle in which art originates,
and which assigns to it a rank so high
among the creations of the human mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although art is addressed to the sensibility,
nevertheless its direct aim is not to
excite sensation, and to give birth to pleasure.
Sensation is changeful, varied, contradictory.
It represents only the various
states or modifications of the soul. If then
we consider only the impressions which
art produces upon us, we make abstraction
of the truth which it reveals to us. It
becomes even impossible to comprehend
its grand effects; for the sentiments which
it excites in us, are explicable only through
the ideas which attach to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sensuous element, nevertheless, occupies
a large place in art. What part
must be assigned to it? There are two
modes of considering sensuous objects in
their connection with our mind. The first
is that of simple perception of objects by
the senses. The mind then knows only
their individual side, their particular and
concrete form; the essence, the law, the
substance of things escapes it. At the
same time the desire which is awakened
in us, is a desire to appropriate them to our
use, to consume them, to destroy them.
The soul, in the presence of these objects,
feels its dependence; it cannot contemplate
them with a free and disinterested
eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another relation of sensuous objects
with spirit, is that of speculative thought
or science. Here the intelligence is not
content to perceive the object in its concrete
form and its individuality; it discards
the individual side in order to abstract
and disengage from it the law, the
universal, the essence. Reason thus lifts
itself above the individual form perceived
by sense, in order to conceive the pure
idea in its universality.</p>

<p class='c006'>Art differs both from the one and from
the other of these modes; it holds the
mean between sensuous perception and
rational abstraction. It is distinguished
from the first in that it does not attach
itself to the real but to the appearance, to
the form of the object, and in that it does
not feel any selfish longing to consume it,
to cause it to serve a purpose, to utilize it.
It differs from science in that it is interested
in this particular object, and in its sensuous
form. What it loves to see in it, is
neither its materiality, nor the pure idea
in its generality, but an appearance, an
image of the truth, something ideal which
appears in it; it seizes the connective of
the two terms, their accord and their inner
harmony. Thus the want which it feels
is wholly contemplative. In the presence
of this vision the soul feels itself freed
from all selfish desire.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a word, art purposely creates images,
appearances, designed to represent ideas,
to show to us the truth under sensuous
forms. Thereby it has the power of stirring
the soul in its profoundest depths, of
causing it to experience the pure delight
springing from the sight and contemplation
of the Beautiful.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two principles are found equally
combined in the artist. The sensuous side
is included in the faculty which creates—the
imagination. It is not by mechanical
toil, directed by rules learned by heart
that he executes his works; nor is it by a
process of reflection like that of the philosopher
who is seeking the truth. The mind
has a consciousness of itself, but it cannot
seize in an abstract manner the idea which
it conceives; it can represent it only under
sensuous forms. The image and the idea
coexist in thought, and cannot be separated.
Thus the imagination is itself a
gift of nature. Scientific genius is rather
a general capacity than an innate and special
talent. To succeed in the arts, there
is necessary a determinate talent which
reveals itself early under the form of
an active and irresistible longing, and
a certain facility in the manipulation
of the materials of art. It is this which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>makes the painter, the sculptor, the musician.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the nature of art. If it be asked,
what is its end, here we encounter the most
diverse opinions. The most common is
that which gives imitation as its object.
This is the foundation of nearly all the
theories upon art. Now of what use to reproduce
that which nature already offers
to our view? This puerile talk, unworthy
of spirit to which it is addressed, unworthy
of man who produces it, would only end
in the revelation of its impotency and
the vanity of its efforts; for the copy will
always remain inferior to the original.
Besides, the more exact the imitation, the
less vivid is the pleasure. That which
pleases us is not imitation, but creation.
The very least invention surpasses all the
masterpieces of imitation.</p>

<p class='c006'>In vain is it said that art ought to imitate
beautiful Nature. To select is no
longer to imitate. Perfection in imitation
is exactness; moreover, choice supposes a
rule; where find the criterion? What
signifies, in fine, imitation in architecture,
in music, and even in poetry? At most,
one can thus explain descriptive poetry,
that is to say, the most prosaic kind. We
must conclude, therefore, that if, in its
compositions, art employs the forms of
Nature, and must study them, its aim is
not to copy and to reproduce them. Its mission
is higher—its procedure freer. Rival
of nature, it represents ideas as well as
she, and even better; it uses her forms as
symbols to express them; and it fashions
even these, remodels them upon a type
more perfect and more pure. It is not
without significance that its works are
styled the creations of the genius of man.</p>

<p class='c006'>A second system substitutes expression
for imitation. Art accordingly has for its
aim, not to represent the external form of
things, but their internal and living principle,
particularly the ideas, sentiments,
passions, and conditions of the soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>Less gross than the preceding, this
theory is no less false and dangerous.
Let us here distinguish two things: the
idea and the expression—the content and
the form. Now, if Art is designed for expression
solely—if expression is its essential
object—its content is indifferent.
Provided that the picture be faithful, the
expression lively and animated, the good
and the bad, the vicious, the hideous, the
ugly, have the same right to figure here as
the Beautiful. Immoral, licentious, impious,
the artist will have fulfilled his obligation
and reached perfection, when he
has succeeded in faithfully rendering a
situation, a passion, an idea, be it true or
false. It is clear that if in this system
the object of imitation is changed, the
procedure is the same. Art would be only
an echo, a harmonious language; a living
mirror, where all sentiments and all
passions would find themselves reflected,
the base part and the noble part of the soul
contending here for the same place. The
true, here, would be the real, would include
objects the most diverse and the most contradictory.
Indifferent as to the content,
the artist seeks only to represent it well. He
troubles himself little concerning truth in
itself. Skeptic or enthusiast indifferently,
he makes us partake of the delirium of
the Bacchanals, or the unconcern of the
Sophist. Such is the system which takes
for a motto the maxim, <i>Art is for art</i>; that
is to say, mere expression for its own sake.
Its consequences, and the fatal tendency
which it has at all times pressed upon the
arts, are well known.</p>

<p class='c006'>A third system sets up <i>moral perfection</i>
as the aim of art. It cannot be denied
that one of the effects of art is to soften
and purify manners (<i>emollit mores</i>). In
mirroring man to himself, it tempers the
rudeness of his appetites and his passions;
it disposes him to contemplation and reflection;
it elevates his thought and sentiments,
by leading them to an ideal which
it suggests,—to ideas of a superior order.
Art has, from all time, been regarded as
a powerful instrument of civilization, as
an auxiliary of religion. It is, together
with religion, the earliest instructor of
nations; it is besides a means of instruction
for minds incapable of comprehending
truth otherwise than under the veil of a
symbol, and by images that address themselves
to the sense as well as to the spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this theory, although much superior
to the preceding, is no more exact. Its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>defect consists in confounding the moral
effect of art with its real aim. This confusion
has inconveniences which do not
appear at the first glance. Let care be
taken, meanwhile, lest, in thus assigning
to art a foreign aim, it be not robbed of
its liberty, which is its essence, and without
which it has no inspiration—that
thereby it be not prevented from producing
the effects which are to be expected
from it. Between religion, morals and
art, there exists an eternal and intimate
harmony; but they are, none the less, essentially
diverse forms of truth, and,
while preserving entire the bonds which
unite them, they claim a complete independence.
Art has its peculiar laws,
methods and jurisdiction; though it ought
not to wound the moral sense, yet it is the
sense of the Beautiful to which it is addressed.
When its works are pure, its
effect on the soul is salutary, but its direct
and immediate aim is not this result.
Seeking it, it risks losing it, and does lose
its own end. Suppose, indeed, that the
aim of art should be to instruct, under the
veil of allegory; the idea, the abstract
and general thought, must be present in
the spirit of the artist at the very moment
of composition. It seeks, then, a form
which is adapted to that idea, and furnishes
drapery for it. Who does not see
that this procedure is the very opposite of
inspiration? There can be born of it only
frigid and lifeless works; its effect will
thus be neither moral nor religious; it
will produce only <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another consequence of the opinion
which makes moral perfection the object
of art and its creations, is that this end is
imposed so completely upon art, and controls
it to such a degree, that it has no
longer even a choice of subjects. The severe
moralist would have it represent moral
subjects alone. Art is then undone. This
system led Plato to banish poets from his
republic. If, then, it is necessary to
maintain the agreement of morality and
art, and the harmony of their laws, their
distinct bases and independence must also
be recognized. In order to understand
thoroughly this distinction between morals
and art, it is necessary to have solved the
moral problem. Morality is the realization
of the “ought” by the free will; it
is the conflict between passion and reason,
inclination and law, the flesh and the
spirit. It hinges upon an opposition.
Antagonism is, indeed, the very law of
the physical and moral universe. But this
opposition ought to be cancelled. This is
the destiny of beings who by their development
and progress continually realize
themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, in morals, this harmony of the
powers of our being, which should restore
peace and happiness, does not exist.
Morality proposes it as an end to the free
will. The aim and the realization are distinct.
Duty consists in an incessant striving.
Thus, in one respect, morals and
art have the same principle and the same
aim; the harmony of rectitude, and happiness
of actions and law. But that
wherein they differ is, that in morals the
end is never wholly attained. It appears
separated from the means; the consequence
is equally separated from the
principle. The harmony of rectitude and
happiness ought to be the result of the
efforts of virtue. In order to conceive
the identity of the two terms, it is necessary
to elevate one’s self to a superior
point of view, which is not that of morals.
In empirical science equally, the law appears
distinct from the phenomenon, the
essence separated from its form. In order
that this distinction may be cancelled,
there is necessary a mode of thinking
which is superior to that of reflection, or
of empirical science.</p>

<p class='c006'>Art, on the contrary, offers to us in a
visible image, the realized harmony of the
two terms of existence, of the law of beings
and their manifestation, of essence
and form, of rectitude and happiness.
The beautiful is essence realized, activity
in conformity with its end, and
identified with it; it is the force which is
harmoniously developed under our eyes,
in the innermost of existences, and
which cancels the contradictions of its
nature: happy, free, full of serenity in
the very midst of suffering and of sorrow.
The problem of art is then distinct from
the moral problem. The good is harmony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>sought for; beauty is harmony realized.
So must we understand the thought of
Hegel; he here only intimates it, but it
will be fully developed in the sequel.</p>

<p class='c006'>The true aim of art is then to represent
the Beautiful, to reveal this harmony. This
is its only purpose. Every other aim,
purification, moral amelioration, edification,
are accessories or consequences. The
effect of the contemplation of the Beautiful
is to produce in us a calm and pure joy, incompatible
with the gross pleasures of
sense; it lifts the soul above the ordinary
sphere of its thoughts; it disposes to noble
resolutions and generous actions by the
close affinity which exists between the three
sentiments and the three ideas of the Good,
the Beautiful, and the Divine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such are the principal ideas which this
remarkable introduction contains. The remainder,
devoted to the examination of
works which have marked the development
of æsthetic science in Germany since
Kant, is scarcely susceptible of analysis,
and does not so much deserve our attention.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The first part</i> of the science of æsthetics,
which might be called the Metaphysics of
the Beautiful, contains, together with the
analysis of the idea of the Beautiful, the
general principles common to all the arts.
Thus Hegel here treats: <i>First, of the abstract
idea of the Beautiful; second, of the
Beautiful in nature; third, of the Beautiful
in art, or of the ideal.</i> He concludes with
an examination of the qualities of the artist.
But before entering upon these questions,
he thought it necessary to point out
the place of art in human life, and especially
<i>its connections with religion and
philosophy</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The destination of man, the law of his
nature, is to develop himself incessantly,
to stretch unceasingly towards the infinite.
He ought, at the same time, to put an end
to the opposition which he finds in himself
between the elements and powers of his being;
to place them in accord by realizing
and developing them externally. Physical
life is a struggle between opposing forces,
and the living being can sustain itself only
through the conflict and the triumph of the
force which constitutes it. With man, and
in the moral sphere, this conflict and progressive
enfranchisement are manifested
under the form of freedom, which is the
highest destination of spirit. Freedom
consists in surmounting the obstacles which
it encounters within and without, in removing
the limits, in effacing all contradiction,
in vanquishing evil and sorrow, in
order to attain to harmony with the world
and with itself. In actual life, man seeks
to destroy that opposition by the satisfaction
of his physical wants. He calls to his
aid, industry and the useful arts; but he
obtains thus only limited, relative, and
transient enjoyments. He finds a nobler
pleasure in science, which furnishes food
for his ardent curiosity, and promises to
reveal to him the laws of nature and to
unveil the secrets of the universe. Civil
life opens another channel to his activity;
he burns to realize his conceptions; he
marches to the conquest of the right, and
pursues the ideal of justice which he bears
within him. He endeavors to realize in
civil society his instinct of sociability,
which is also the law of his being, and one
of the fundamental inclinations of his moral
nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>But here, again, he attains an imperfect
felicity; he encounters limits and obstacles
which he cannot surmount, and against
which, his will is broken. He cannot obtain
the perfect realization of his ideas,
nor attain the ideal which his spirit conceives
and toward which it aspires. He
then feels the necessity of elevating himself
to a higher sphere where all contradictions
are cancelled; where the idea of the
good and of happiness in their perfect accord
and their enduring harmony is realized.
This profound want of the soul is
satisfied in three ways: in <i>art</i>, in <i>religion</i>,
and in <i>philosophy</i>. The function of art is
to lead us to the contemplation of the true,
the infinite, under sensuous forms; for the
beautiful is the unity, the realized harmony
of two principles of existence, of the
idea and the form, of the infinite and the
finite. This is the principle and the hidden
essence of things, beaming through
their visible form. Art presents us, in its
works, the image of this happy accord
where all opposition ceases, and where all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>contradiction is cancelled. Such is the
aim of art: to represent the divine, the infinite,
under sensuous forms. This is its
mission; it has no other and this it alone
can fulfil. By this title it takes its place
by the side of religion, and preserves its
independence. It takes its rank also with
philosophy, whose object is the knowledge
of the true, of absolute truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Alike then as to their general ground
and aims, these three spheres are distinguished
by the form under which they become
revealed to the spirit and consciousness
of man. Art is addressed to sensuous
perception and to the imagination; religion
is addressed to the soul, to the conscience,
and to sentiment; philosophy is
addressed to pure thought or to the reason,
which conceives the truth in an abstract
manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>Art, which offers us truth under sensuous
forms, does not, however, respond to
the profoundest needs of the soul. The
spirit is possessed of the desire of entering
into itself, of contemplating the truth in
the inner recesses of consciousness. Above
the domain of art, then, religion is placed,
which reveals the infinite, and by meditation
conveys to the depths of the heart, to
the centre of the soul, that which in art we
contemplate externally. As to philosophy,
its peculiar aim is to conceive and to comprehend,
by the intellect alone, under an
abstract form, that which is given as sentiment
or as sensuous representation.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. <i>Of the Idea of the Beautiful.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>After these preliminaries, Hegel enters
upon the questions which form the object
of this first part. He treats, in the first
place, of <i>the idea of the beautiful</i> in itself,
in its abstract nature. Freeing his thought
from the metaphysical forms which render
it difficult of comprehension to minds not
familiar with his system, we arrive at this
definition, already contained in the foregoing:
the Beautiful is the true, that is to
say, the essence, the inmost substance of
things; the true, not such as the mind conceives
it in its abstract and pure nature,
but as manifested to the senses under visible
forms. It is the sensuous <i>manifestation
of the idea</i>, which is the soul and
principle of things. This definition recalls
that of Plato: the Beautiful is the <i>splendor
of the true</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>What are the characteristics of the beautiful?
First, it is infinite in this sense,
that it is the divine principle itself which
is revealed and manifested, and that the
form which expresses it, in place of limiting
it, realizes it and confounds itself with
it; second, it is free, for true freedom is
not the absence of rule and measure, it is
force which develops itself easily and harmoniously.
It appears in the bosom of
the existences of the sensuous world, as
their principle of life, of unity, and of
harmony, whether free from all obstacle,
or victorious and triumphant in conflict,
always calm and serene.</p>

<p class='c006'>The spectator who contemplates beauty
feels himself equally free, and has a consciousness
of his infinite nature. He tastes
a pure pleasure, resulting from the felt accord
of the powers of his being; a celestial
and divine joy, which has nothing in common
with material pleasures, and does not
suffer to exist in the soul a single impure
or gross desire.</p>

<p class='c006'>The contemplation of the Beautiful
awakens no such craving; it is self-sufficing,
and is not accompanied by any return
of the me upon itself. It suffers the
object to preserve its independence for its
own sake. The soul experiences something
analogous to divine felicity; it is
transported into a sphere foreign to the
miseries of life and terrestrial existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>This theory, it is apparent, would need
only to be developed to return wholly to the
Platonic theory. Hegel limits himself to
referring to it. We recognize here, also,
the results of the Kantian analysis.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. <i>Of the Beautiful in Nature.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Although science cannot pause to describe
the beauties of nature, it ought,
nevertheless, to study, in a general manner,
the characteristics of the Beautiful,
as it appears to us in the physical world
and in the beings which it contains. This is
the subject of a somewhat extended chapter,
with the following title: <i>Of the Beautiful
in Nature</i>. Hegel herein considers
the question from the particular point of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>view of his philosophy, and he applies his
theory of the <i>Idea</i>. Nevertheless, the results
at which he arrives, and the manner
in which he describes the forms of physical
beauty, can be comprehended and accepted
independently of his system, little adapted,
it must be confessed, to cast light upon
this subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Beautiful in nature is the first manifestation
of the Idea. The successive degrees
of beauty correspond to the development
of life and organization in beings.
Unity is an essential characteristic of it.
Thus, in the mineral, beauty consists in the
arrangement or disposition of the parts,
in the force which resides in them, and
which reveals itself in this unity. The solar
system offers us a more perfect unity
and a higher beauty. The bodies in that
system, while preserving entire their individual
existence, co-ordinate themselves
into a whole, the parts of which are independent,
although attached to a common
centre, the sun. Beauty of this order
strikes us by the regularity of the movements
of the celestial bodies. A unity
more real and true is that which is manifested
in organized and living beings. The
unity here consists in a relation of reciprocity
and of mutual dependence between
the organs, so that each of them
loses its independent existence in order to
give place to a wholly ideal unity which
reveals itself as the principle of life animating
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Life is beautiful in nature: for it is essence,
force, the idea realized under its
first form. Nevertheless, beauty in nature
is still wholly external; it has no consciousness
of itself; it is beautiful solely for an
intelligence which sees and contemplates
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>How do we perceive beauty in natural
beings? Beauty, with living and animate
beings, is neither accidental and capricious
movements, nor simple conformity of those
movements to an end—the uniform and
mutual connection of parts. This point of
view is that of the naturalist, of the man
of science; it is not that of the Beautiful.
Beauty is total form in so far as it reveals
the force which animates it; it is this
force itself, manifested by a totality of
forms, of independent and free movements;
it is the internal harmony which
reveals itself in this secret accord of members,
and which betrays itself outwardly,
without the eye’s pausing to consider the
relation of the parts to the whole, and their
functions or reciprocal connection, as science
does. The unity exhibits itself merely
externally as the principle which binds
the members together. It manifests itself
especially through the sensibility. The
point of view of beauty is then that of pure
contemplation, not that of reflection,
which analyzes, compares and seizes the
connection of parts and their destination.</p>

<p class='c006'>This internal and visible unity, this accord,
and this harmony, are not distinct
from the material element; they are its
very form. This is the principle which
serves to determine beauty in its inferior
grades, the beauty of the crystal with its
regular forms, forms produced by an internal
and free force. A similar activity
is developed in a more perfect manner in
the living organism, its outlines, the disposition
of its members, the movements, and
the expression of sensibility.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is beauty in individual beings. It
is otherwise with it when we consider nature
in its totality, the beauty of a landscape,
for example. There is no longer
question here about an organic disposition
of parts and of the life which animates
them; we have under our eyes a rich multiplicity
of objects which form a whole,
mountains, trees, rivers, etc. In this diversity
there appears an external unity
which interests us by its agreeable or imposing
character. To this aspect there is
added that property of the objects of nature
through which they awaken in us,
sympathetically, certain sentiments, by the
secret analogy which exists between them
and the situations of the human soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the effect produced by the silence
of the night, the calm of a still valley, the
sublime aspect of a vast sea in tumult,
and the imposing grandeur of the starry
heavens. The significance of these objects
is not in themselves; they are only symbols
of the sentiments of the soul which
they excite. It is thus we attribute to animals
the qualities which belong only to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>man, courage, fortitude, cunning. Physical
beauty is a reflex of moral beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>To recapitulate, physical beauty, viewed
in its ground or essence, consists in the
manifestation of the concealed principle,
of the force which is developed in the bosom
of matter. This force reveals itself
in a manner more or less perfect, by unity
in inert matter, and in living beings by the
different modes of organization.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hegel then devotes a special examination
to the external side, or to beauty of form
in natural objects. Physical beauty, considered
externally, presents itself successively
under the aspects of <i>regularity</i> and
<i>symmetry</i>, of <i>conformity</i> to law and of <i>harmony</i>;
lastly, of <i>purity</i> and simplicity of
matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Regularity</i>, which is only the repetition
of a form equal to itself, is the most
elementary and simple form. In <i>symmetry</i>
there already appears a diversity which
breaks the uniformity. These two forms
of beauty pertain to <i>quantity</i>, and constitute
mathematical beauty; they are found
in organic and inorganic bodies, minerals
and crystals. In plants are presented less
regular, and freer forms. In the organization
of animals, this regular and symmetrical
disposition becomes more and
more subordinated in proportion as we ascend
to higher degrees of the animal scale.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Conformity to a law</i> marks a degree
still more elevated, and serves as a transition
to freer forms. Here there appears
an accord more real and more profound,
which begins to transcend mathematical
rigor. It is no longer a simple numerical
relation, where quantity plays the principal
rôle; we discover a relation of quality
between different terms. A law rules
the whole, but it cannot be calculated;
it remains a hidden bond, which
reveals itself to the spectator. Such is
the oval line, and above all, the undulating
line, which Hogarth has given as the line
of beauty. These lines determine, in fact,
the beautiful forms of organic nature in
living beings of a high order, and, above
all, the beautiful forms of the human body,
of man and of woman.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>Harmony</i> is a degree still superior to
the preceding, and it includes them. It
consists in a totality of elements essentially
distinct, but whose opposition is
destroyed and reduced to unity by a secret
accord, a reciprocal adaptation. Such is
the harmony of forms and colors, that of
sounds and movements, Here the unity is
stronger, more <i>prononcé</i>, precisely because
the differences and the oppositions
are more marked. Harmony, however, is
not as yet true unity, spiritual unity,
that of the soul, although the latter possesses
within it a principle of harmony.
Harmony alone, as yet, reveals neither the
soul nor the spirit, as one may see in music
and dancing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Beauty exists also in matter itself,
abstraction being made of its form; it
consists, then, in the unity and <i>simplicity</i>
which constitutes <i>purity</i>. Such is the
purity of the sky and of the atmosphere,
the purity of colors and of sounds; that of
certain substances—of precious stones, of
gold, and of the diamond. Pure and simple
colors are also the most agreeable.</p>

<p class='c006'>After having described the beautiful in
nature, in order that the necessity of a
beauty more exalted and more ideal shall
be comprehended, Hegel sets forth the <i>imperfections</i>
of real beauty. He begins with
animal life, which is the most elevated
point we have reached, and he dwells upon
the characteristics and causes of that imperfection.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, first in the animal, although the
organism is more perfect than that of the
plant, what we see is not the central point
of life; the special seat of the operations
of the force which animates the whole, remains
concealed from us. We see only
the outlines of the external form, covered
with hairs, scales, feathers, skin; secondly,
the human body, it is true, exhibits
more beautiful proportions, and a more
perfect form, because in it, life and sensibility
are everywhere manifested—in the
color, the flesh, the freer movements,
nobler attitudes, &amp;c. Yet here, besides
the imperfections in details, the sensibility
does not appear equally distributed.
Certain parts are appropriated to animal
functions, and exhibit their destination in
their form. Further, individuals in nature,
placed as they are under a dependence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>upon external causes, and under the influence
of the elements, are under the
dominion of necessity and want. Under
the continual action of these causes, physical
being is exposed to losing the fulness
of its forms and the flower of its beauty;
rarely do these causes permit it to attain
to its complete, free and regular development.
The human body is placed under a
like dependence upon external agents. If
we pass from the physical to the moral
world, that dependence appears still more
clearly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Everywhere there is manifested diversity,
and opposition of tendencies and
interests. The individual, in the plenitude
of his life and beauty, cannot preserve
the appearance of a free force. Each
individual being is limited and particularized
in his excellence. His life flows in a
narrow circle of space and time; he belongs
to a determinate species; his type
is given, his form defined, and the conditions
of his development fixed. The human
body itself offers, in respect to beauty,
a progression of forms dependent on the
diversity of races. Then come hereditary
qualities, the peculiarities which are due
to temperament, profession, age, and sex.
All these causes alter and disfigure the
purest and most perfect primitive type.</p>

<p class='c006'>All these imperfections are summed up
in a word: the finite. Human life and
animal life realize their idea only imperfectly.
Moreover, spirit—not being able
to find, in the limits of the real, the sight
and the enjoyment of its proper freedom—seeks
to satisfy itself in a region more elevated,
that of <i>art</i>, or of the ideal.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. <i>Of the beautiful in Art or of the Ideal.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Art has as its end and aim the representation
of the ideal. Now what is the
<i>ideal</i>? It is beauty in a degree of perfection
superior to real beauty. It is force,
life, spirit, the essence of things, developing
themselves harmoniously in a sensuous
reality, which is its resplendent image,
its faithful expression; it is beauty disengaged
and purified from the accidents
which veil and disfigure it, and which alter
its purity in the real world.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ideal, in art, is not then the contrary
of the real, but the real idealized,
purified, rendered conformable to its
idea, and perfectly expressing it. In a
word, it is the perfect accord of the idea
and the sensuous form.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, the true ideal is not
life in its inferior degrees—blind, undeveloped
force—but the soul arrived at the
consciousness of itself, free, and in the
full enjoyment of its faculties; it is life,
but spiritual life—in a word, spirit. The
representation of the spiritual principle, in
the plenitude of its life and freedom, with
its high conceptions, its profound and noble
sentiments, its joys and its sufferings:
this is the true aim of art, the true ideal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally, the ideal is not a lifeless abstraction,
a frigid generality; it is the
spiritual principle under the form of the
living individual, freed from the bonds of
the finite, and developing itself in its perfect
harmony with its inmost nature and
essence.</p>

<p class='c006'>We see, thus, what are the characteristics
of the ideal. It is evident that in all
its degrees it is calmness, serenity, felicity,
happy existence, freed from the miseries
and wants of life. This serenity
does not exclude earnestness; for the ideal
appears in the midst of the conflicts of
life; but even in the roughest experiences,
in the midst of intense suffering, the soul
preserves an evident calmness as a fundamental
trait. It is felicity in suffering,
the glorification of sorrow, smiling in
tears. The echo of this felicity resounds
in all the spheres of the ideal.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is important to determine, with still
more precision, the relations of the <i>ideal</i>
and the <i>real</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The opposition of the ideal and the real
has given rise to two conflicting opinions.
Some conceive of the ideal as something
vague, an abstract, lifeless generality,
without individuality. Others extol the
natural, the imitation of the real in the
most minute and prosaic details. Equal
exaggeration! The truth lies between the
two extremes.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, the ideal may be, in
fact, something external and accidental,
an insignificant form or appearance, a
common existence. But that which constitutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the ideal, in this inferior degree,
is the fact that this reality, imitated by
art, is a creation of spirit, and becomes
then something artificial, not real. It is
an image and a metamorphosis. This
image, moreover, is more permanent than
its model, more durable than the real object.
In fixing that which is mobile and
transient, in eternizing that which is momentary
and fugitive—a flower, a smile—art
surpasses nature and idealizes it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it does not stop here. Instead of
simply reproducing these objects, while
preserving their natural form, it seizes
their internal and deepest character, it
extends their signification, and gives to
them a more elevated and more general
significance; for it must manifest the universal
in the individual, and render visible
the idea which they represent, their eternal
and fixed type. It allows this character
of generality to penetrate everywhere,
without reducing it to an abstraction.
Thus the artist does not slavishly reproduce
all the features of the object, and its
accidents, but only the true traits, those
conformable to its idea. If, then, he takes
nature as a model, he still surpasses and
idealizes it. Naturalness, faithfulness,
truth, these are not exact imitation, but
the perfect conformity of the form to the
idea; they are the creation of a more
perfect form, whose essential traits represent
the idea more faithfully and more
clearly than it is expressed in nature itself.
To know how to disengage the operative,
energetic, essential and significant elements
in objects,—this is the task of the
artist. The ideal, then, is not the real; the
latter contains many elements insignificant,
useless, confused and foreign, or opposed
to the idea. The natural here loses
its vulgar significance. By this word must
be understood the more exalted expression
of spirit. The ideal is a transfigured, glorified
nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to vulgar and common nature, if art
takes it also for its object, it is not for its
own sake, but because of what in it is
true, excellent, interesting, ingenuous or
gay, as in <i>genre</i> painting, in Dutch painting
particularly. It occupies, nevertheless,
an inferior rank, and cannot make
pretensions to a place beside the grand
compositions of art.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there are other subjects—a nature
more elevated and more ideal. Art, at its
culminating stage, represents the development
of the internal powers of the soul,
its grand passions, profound sentiments,
and lofty destinies. Now, it is clear that
the artist does not find in the real world,
forms so pure and ideal that he may safely
confine himself to imitating and copying.
Moreover, if the form itself be given, expression
must be added. Besides, he
ought to secure, in a just measure, the
union of the individual and the universal,
of the form and the idea; to create a
living ideal, penetrated with the idea, and
in which it animates the sensuous form
and appearance throughout, so that there
shall be nothing in it empty or insignificant,
nothing that is not alive with expression
itself. Where shall he find in
the real world, this just measure, this
animation, and this exact correspondence
of all the parts and of all the details conspiring
to the same end, to the same effect?
To say that he will succeed in conceiving
and realizing the ideal, by making a felicitous
selection of ideas and forms, is to
ignore the secret of artistic composition;
it is to misconceive the entirely spontaneous
method of genius,—inspiration which
creates at a single effort,—to replace it by a
reflective drudgery, which only results in
the production of frigid and lifeless
works.</p>

<p class='c006'>It does not suffice to define the ideal in
an abstract manner; the ideal is exhibited
to us in the works of art under very various
and diverse forms. Thus sculpture
represents it under the motionless features
of its figures. In the other arts it assumes
the form of movement and of action; in
poetry, particularly, it manifests itself in
the midst of most varied situations and
events, of conflicts between persons animated
by diverse passions. How, and
under what conditions, is each art in particular
called upon to represent thus the
ideal? This will be the object of the
theory of the arts. In the general exposition
of the principles of art, we may,
nevertheless, attempt to define the degrees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of this development, to study the principal
aspects under which it manifests itself.
Such is the object of those considerations,
the title of which is, <i>Of
the Determination of the Ideal</i>, and
which the author develops in this first
part of the work. We can trace only
summarily the principal ideas, devoting
ourselves to marking their order and connection.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gradation which the author establishes
between the progressively determined
forms of the ideal is as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The ideal, under the most elevated
form, is the divine idea, the divine such
as the imagination can represent it under
sensuous forms; such is the Greek ideal
of the divinities of Polytheism; such the
Christian ideal in its highest purity, under
the form of God the Father, of Christ, of
the Virgin, of the Apostles, etc. It is
given above all to sculpture and painting,
to present us the image of it. Its essential
characteristics are calmness, majesty,
serenity.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. In a degree less elevated, but more
determined, in the circle of human life,
the ideal appears to us, with man, as the
victory of the eternal principles which fill
the human heart, the triumph of the noble
part of the soul over the inferior and
passionate. The noble, the excellent,
the perfect, in the human soul, is the
moral and divine principle which is manifested
in it, which governs its will, and
causes it to accomplish grand actions;
this is the true source of self-sacrifice and
of heroism.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. But the idea, when it is manifested
in the real world, can be developed only
under the form of <i>action</i>. Now, action
itself has for its condition a conflict between
principles and persons, divided as
to interests, ideas, passions, and characters.
It is this especially that is represented
by poetry—the art <i>par excellence</i>,
the only art which can reproduce an action
in its successive phases, with its complications,
its sudden turns of fortune, its
catastrophe and its denouement.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Action</i>, if one considers it more closely,
includes the following conditions: 1st. A
world which serves it as a basis and theatre,
<i>a form of society</i> which renders it possible,
and is favorable to the development
of ideal figures. 2d. A determinate situation,
in which the personages are placed
who render necessary the conflict between
opposing interests and passions, whence
a collision may arise. 3d. An action, properly
so called, which develops itself in
its essential moments, which has a beginning,
a middle, and an end. This action,
in order to afford a high interest, should
revolve upon ideas of an elevated order,
which inspire and sustain the personages,
ennobling their passions, and forming the
basis of their character.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hegel treats, in a general manner, each
of these points, which will appear anew,
under a more special form, in the study of
poetry, and particularly of epic and dramatic
poetry.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The state of society most favorable
to the ideal is that which allows the characters
to act with most freedom, to reveal
a lofty and powerful personality. This
cannot be a social order, where all is fixed
and regulated by laws and a constitution.
Nor can it be the savage state, where all
is subject to caprice and violence, and
where man is dependent upon a thousand
external causes, which render his existence
precarious. Now the state intermediate
between the barbarous state and an advanced
civilization, is the <i>heroic age</i>, that
in which the epic poets locate their action,
and from which the tragic poets themselves
have often borrowed their subjects
and their personages. That which characterizes
heroes in this epoch is, above all,
the independence which is manifested in
their characters and acts. On the other
hand, the hero is all of a piece; he assumes
not only the responsibility of his
acts and their consequences, but the results
of actions he has not perpetrated,
of the faults or crimes of his race; he
bears in his person an entire race.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another reason why the ideal existences
of art belong to the mythologic ages, and
to remote epochs of history, is that the
artist or the poet, in representing or recounting
events, has a freer scope in his
ideal creations. Art, also, for the same
reason, has a predilection for the higher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>conditions of society, those of princes particularly,
because of the perfect independence
of will and action which characterizes
them. In this respect, our actual
society, with its civil and political organization,
its manners, administration, police,
etc., is prosaic. The sphere of activity of
the individual is too restricted; he encounters
everywhere limits and shackles
to his will. Our monarchs themselves are
subject to these conditions; their power is
limited by institutions, laws and customs.
War, peace, and treaties are determined
by political relations independent of their
will.</p>

<p class='c006'>The greatest poets have not been able
to escape these conditions; and when they
have desired to represent personages
nearer to us, as Charles Moor, or Wallenstein,
they have been obliged to place
them in revolt against society or against
their sovereign. Moreover, these heroes
rush on to an inevitable ruin, or they fall
into the ridiculous situation, of which the
Don Quixote of Cervantes gives us the
most striking example.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. To represent the ideal in personages
or in an action, there is necessary not only
a favorable world from which the subject
is to be borrowed, but a situation. This
situation can be either indeterminate, like
that of many of the immobile personages
of antique or religious sculpture, or determinate,
but yet of little earnestness.
Such are also the greater number of the
situations of the personages of antique
sculpture. Finally, it may be earnest, and
furnish material for a veritable action. It
supposes, then, an opposition, an action and
a reaction, a conflict, a collision. The
beauty of the ideal consists in absolute
serenity and perfection. Now, collision
destroys this harmony. The problem of
art consists, then, in so managing that the
harmony reappears in the denouement. Poetry
alone is capable of developing this opposition
upon which the interest, particularly,
of tragic art turns.</p>

<p class='c006'>Without examining here the nature of
the different <i>collisions</i>, the study of which
belongs to the theory of dramatic art, we
must already have remarked that the collisions
of the highest order are those in
which the conflict takes place between
moral forces, as in the ancient tragedies.
This is the subject of true classic tragedy,
moral as well as religious, as will be seen
from what follows.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the ideal, in this superior degree,
is the manifestation of moral powers and
of the ideas of spirit, of the grand movements
of the soul, and of the characters
which appear and are revealed in the development
of the representation.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. In <i>action</i>, properly so-called, three
things are to be considered which constitute
its ideal object: 1. The general interests,
the ideas, the universal principles,
whose opposition forms the very foundation
of the action; 2. The personages; 3. Their
character and their passions, or the motives
which impel them to act.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, the eternal principles
of religion, of morality, of the family, of
the state—the grand sentiments of the
soul, love, honor, etc.—these constitute the
basis, the true interest of the action.
These are the grand and true motives of
art, the eternal theme of exalted poetry.</p>

<p class='c006'>To these legitimate and true powers others
are, without doubt, added; the powers
of evil; but they ought not to be represented
as forming the real foundation and
end of the action. “If the idea, the end
and aim, be something false in itself, the
hideousness of the ground will allow still
less beauty of form. The sophistry of the
passions may, indeed, by a true picture,
attempt to represent the false under the
colors of the true, but it places under our
eyes only a whited sepulchre. Cruelty and
the violent employment of force can be endured
in representation, but only when
they are relieved by the grandeur of the
character and ennobled by the aim which
is pursued by the <i>dramatis personæ</i>. Perversity,
envy, cowardice, baseness, are only
repulsive.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Evil, in itself, is stripped of real interest,
because nothing but the false can
spring from what is false; it produces only
misfortune, while art should present to
us order and harmony. The great artists,
the great poets of antiquity, never give us
the spectacle of pure wickedness and perversity.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>We cite this passage because it exhibits
the character and high moral tone which
prevails in the entire work, as we shall
have occasion to observe more than once
hereafter.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the ideas and interests of human life
form the ground of the action, the latter is
accomplished by the characters upon whom
the interest is fastened. General ideas
may, indeed, be personated by beings superior
to man, by certain divinities like
those which figure in ancient epic poetry
and tragedy. But it is to man that action,
properly so-called, returns; it is he who
occupies the scene. Now, how reconcile
divine action and human action, the will
of the gods and that of man? Such is the
problem which has made shipwreck of so
many poets and artists. To maintain a
proper equipoise it is necessary that the
gods have supreme direction, and that man
preserve his freedom and his independence
without which he is no more than the passive
instrument of the will of the gods; fatality
weighs upon all his acts. The true
solution consists in maintaining the identity
of the two terms, in spite of their difference;
in so acting that what is attributed
to the gods shall appear at the same time
to emanate from the inner nature of the
<i>dramatis personæ</i> and from their character.
The talent of the artist must reconcile the
two aspects. “The heart of man must be
revealed in his gods, personifications of
the grand motives which allure him and
govern him within.” This is the problem
resolved by the great poets of antiquity,
Homer, Æschylus, and Sophocles.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general principles, those grand motives
which are the basis of the action, by
the fact that they are living in the soul of
the characters, form, also, the very ground
of the <i>passions</i>; this is the essence of true
pathos. Passion, here, in the elevated ideal
sense, is, in fact, not an arbitrary, capricious,
irregular movement of the soul; it is
a noble principle, which blends itself with
a great idea, with one of the eternal verities
of moral or religious order. Such is
the passion of Antigone, the holy love for
her brother; such, the vengeance of Orestes.
It is an essentially legitimate power of the
soul which contains one of the eternal
principles of the reason and the will. This
is still the ideal, the true ideal, although it
appears under the form of a passion. It
relieves, ennobles and purifies it; it thus
gives to the action a serious and profound
interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is in this sense that passion constitutes
the centre and true domain of art; it
is the principle of emotion, the source of
true pathos.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, this moral verity, this eternal
principle which descends into the heart of
man and there takes the form of great and
noble passion, identifying itself with the
will of the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, constitutes,
also, their character. Without this high
idea which serves as support and as basis
to passion, there is no true character.
Character is the culminating point of ideal
representation. It is the embodiment of
all that precedes. It is in the creation
of the characters, that the genius of the artist
or of the poet is displayed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Three principal elements must be united
to form the ideal character, <i>richness</i>, <i>vitality</i>,
and <i>stability</i>. Richness consists in not
being limited to a single quality, which
would make of the person an abstraction,
an allegoric being. To a single dominant
quality there should be added all those
which make of the personage or hero
a real and complete man, capable of being
developed in diverse situations and
under varying aspects. Such a multiplicity
alone can give vitality to the character.
This is not sufficient, however; it is necessary
that the qualities be moulded together
in such a manner as to form not a simple
assemblage and a complex whole, but one
and the same individual, having peculiar
and original physiognomy. This is the
case when a particular sentiment, a ruling
passion, presents the salient trait of the
character of a person, and gives to him a
fixed aim, to which all his resolutions and
his acts refer. Unity and variety, simplicity
and completeness of detail, these
are presented to us in the characters of
Sophocles, Shakspeare, and others.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lastly, what constitutes essentially the
ideal in character is consistency and stability.
An inconsistent, undecided, irresolute
character, is the utter want of character.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Contradictions, without doubt, exist in human
nature, but unity should be maintained
in spite of these fluctuations. Something
identical ought to be found throughout,
as a fundamental trait. To be self-determining,
to follow a design, to embrace a
resolution and persist in it, constitute the
very foundation of personality; to suffer
one’s self to be determined by another, to
hesitate, to vacillate, this is to surrender
one’s will, to cease to be one’s self, to lack
character; this is, in all cases, the opposite
of the ideal character.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hegel on this subject strongly protests
against the characters which figure in modern
pieces and romances, and of which
Werther is the type.</p>

<p class='c006'>These pretended characters, says he, represent
only unhealthiness of spirit, and
feebleness of soul. Now true and healthy
art does not represent what is false and
sickly, what lacks consistency and decision,
but that which is true, healthy and
strong. The ideal, in a word, is the idea
realized; man can realize it only as a free
person, that is to say, by displaying all
the energy and constancy which can make
it triumph.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall find more than once, in the
course of the work, the same ideas developed
with the same force and precision.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which constitutes the very ground
of the ideal is the inmost essence of things,
especially the lofty conceptions of the
spirit, and the development of the powers
of the soul. These ideas are manifest in
an action in which are placed upon the
scene the grand interests of life, the passions
of the human heart, the will and the
character of actors. But this action is
itself developed in the midst of an external
nature which, moreover, lends to the ideal,
colors and a determinate form. These
external surroundings must also be conceived
and fashioned in the meaning of the
ideal, according to the laws of <i>regularity</i>,
<i>symmetry</i>, and <i>harmony</i>, of which mention
has been made above. How ought man to be
represented in his relations with external
nature? How ought this prose of life to be
idealized? If art, in fact, frees man from
the wants of material life, it cannot, however,
elevate him above the conditions of
human existence, and suppress these connections.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hegel devotes a special examination to
this new phase of the question of the ideal,
which he designates by this title—<i>Of the
external determination of the ideal</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In our days we have given an exaggerated
importance to this external side, which
we have made the principal object. We
are too unmindful that art should represent
the ideas and sentiments of the human
soul, that this is the true ground of
its works. Hence all these minute descriptions,
this external care given to the
picturesque element or to the local color,
to furniture, to costumes, to all those artificial
means employed to disguise the
emptiness and insignificance of the subject,
the absence of ideas, the falsity of
the situations, the feebleness of the characters,
and the improbability of the
action.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, this side has its place in
art, and should not be neglected. It gives
clearness, truthfulness, life, and interest
to its works, by the secret sympathy which
exists between man and nature. It is
characteristic of the great masters to represent
nature with perfect truthfulness.
Homer is an example of this. Without
forgetting the content for the form, picture
for the frame, he presents to us a
faultless and precise image of the theatre
of action. The arts differ much in this
respect. Sculpture limits itself to certain
symbolic indications; painting, which has
at its disposal means more extended, enriches
with these objects the content of its
pictures. Among the varieties of poetry, the
epic is more circumstantial in its descriptions
than the drama or lyric poetry. But
this external fidelity should not, in any
art, extend to the representation of insignificant
details, to the making of them an
object of predilection, and to subordinating
to them the developments which the
subject itself claims. The grand point in
these descriptions is that we perceive a
secret harmony between man and nature,
between the action and the theatre on
which it occurs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another species of accord is established
between man and the objects of physical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>nature, when, through his free activity, he
impresses upon them his intelligence and
will, and appropriates them to his own
use; the ideal consists in causing misery
and necessity to disappear from the domain
of art, in revealing the freedom
which develops itself without effort under
our eyes, and easily surmounts obstacles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the ideal considered under this
aspect. Thus the gods of polytheism
themselves have garments and arms; they
drink nectar and are nourished by ambrosia.
The garment is an ornament designed
to heighten the glory of the features, to
give nobleness to the countenance, to facilitate
movement, or to indicate force and
agility. The most brilliant objects, the
metals, precious stones, purple and ivory,
are employed for the same end. All concur
to produce the effect of grace and
beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the satisfaction of physical wants the
ideal consists, above all, in the simplicity
of the means. Instead of being artificial,
factitious, complex, the latter emanate
directly from the activity of man, and freedom.
The heroes of Homer themselves
slay the oxen which are to serve for the
feast, and roast them; they forge their
arms, and prepare their couches. This is
not, as one might think, a relic of barbarous
manners, something prosaic; but we
see, penetrating everywhere the delight of
invention, the pleasure of easy toil and
free activity exercised on material objects.
Everything is peculiar to and inherent in
his character, and a means for the hero
of revealing the force of his arm and the
skill of his hand; while, in civilized society,
these objects depend on a thousand
foreign causes, on a complex adjustment
in which man is converted into a machine
subordinated to other machines. Things
have lost their freshness and vitality;
they remain inanimate, and are no longer
proper, direct creations of the human person,
in which the man loves to solace and
contemplate himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>A final point relative to the external
<i>form of the ideal</i> is that which concerns
the <i>relation of works of art to the public</i>,
that is to say, to the nation and epoch for
which the artist or the poet composes his
works. Ought the artist, when he treats a
subject, to consult, above all, the spirit,
taste and manners of the people whom he
addresses, and conform himself to their
ideas? This is the means of exciting interest
in fabulous and imaginary or even
historic persons. But then there is a liability
to distort history and tradition.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ought he, on the other hand, to reproduce
with scrupulous exactness the manners
and customs of another time, to give
to the facts and the characters their proper
coloring and their original and primitive
costume? This is the problem. Hence
arise two schools and two opposite modes
of representation. In the age of Louis
XIV., for example, the Greeks and Romans
are conceived in the likeness of Frenchmen.
Since then, by a natural reaction,
the contrary tendency has prevailed. Today
the poet must have the knowledge of
an archeologist, and possess his scrupulous
exactness, and pay close attention,
above all, to local color, and historic verity
has become the principal and essential
aim of art.</p>

<p class='c006'>Truth here, as always, lies between the
two extremes. It is necessary to maintain,
at the same time, the rights of art and
these of the public, to have a proper regard
for the spirit of the epoch, and to
satisfy the exigencies of the subject
treated. These are the very judicious
rules which the author states upon this
delicate point.</p>

<p class='c006'>The subject should be intelligible and
interesting to the public to which it is addressed.
But this end the poet or the
artist will attain only so far as, by his
general spirit, his work responds to some
one of the essential ideas of the human
spirit and to the general interests of humanity.
The particularities of an epoch
are not of true and enduring interest
to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, then, the subject is borrowed from remote
epochs of history, or from some far-off
tradition, it is necessary that, by our
general culture, we should be familiarized
with it. It is thus only that we can sympathize
with an epoch and with manners
that are no more. Hence the two essential
conditions; that the subject present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the general human character, then that it
be in relation with our ideas.</p>

<p class='c006'>Art is not designed for a small number
of scholars and men of science; it is addressed
to the entire nation. Its works
should be comprehended and relished of
themselves, and not after a course of difficult
research. Thus national subjects are
the most favorable. All great poems are
national poems. The Bible histories have
for us a particular charm, because we are
familiar with them from our infancy. Nevertheless,
in the measure that relations are
multiplied between peoples, art can borrow
its subjects from all latitudes and from
all epochs. It should, indeed, as to the
principal features, preserve, to the traditions,
events, and personages, to manners
and institutions, their historic or traditional
character; but the duty of the artist,
above all, is to place the idea which constitutes
its content in harmony with the
spirit of his own age, and the peculiar
genius of his nation.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this necessity lies the reason and excuse
for what is called anachronism in art.
When the anachronism bears only upon
external circumstances it is unimportant.
It becomes a matter of more moment if
we attribute to the characters, the ideas,
and sentiments of another epoch. Respect
must be paid to historic truth, but
regard must also be had to the manners
and intellectual culture of one’s own time.
The heroes of Homer themselves are more
than were the real personages of the epoch
which he presents; and the characters of
Sophocles are brought still nearer to us.
To violate thus the rules of historic reality,
is a necessary anachronism in art. Finally,
another form of anachronism, which
the utmost moderation and genius can
alone make pardonable, is that which
transfers the religious or moral ideas of a
more advanced civilization to an anterior
epoch; when one attributes, for example,
to the ancients the ideas of the moderns.
Some great poets have ventured upon
this intentionally; few have been successful
in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general conclusion is this: “The
artist should be required to make himself
the cotemporary of past ages, and become
penetrated himself with their spirit. For if
the substance of those ideas be true, it remains
clear for all time. But to undertake
to reproduce with a scrupulous exactness
the external element of history, with all its
details and particulars,—in a word, all the
rust of antiquity, is the work of a puerile
erudition, which attaches itself only to a
superficial aim. We should not wrest from
art the right which it has to float between
reality and fiction.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This first part concludes with an examination
of the qualities necessary to an
artist, such as imagination, genius, inspiration,
originality, etc. The author does
not deem it obligatory to treat at much
length this subject, which appears to him
to allow only a small number of general
rules or psychological observations. The
manner in which he treats of many points,
and particularly of the imagination, causes
us to regret that he has not thought it
worth while to give a larger space to these
questions, which occupy the principal
place in the majority of æsthetical treatises;
we shall find them again under another
form in the theory of the arts.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>NOTES ON RAPHAEL’S “TRANSFIGURATION.”</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>[Read before the St. Louis Art Society in November, 1866.]</p>
<h4 class='c012'>I. <span class='fss'>THE ENGRAVING.</span></h4>
<p class='c005'>He who studies the “Transfiguration”
of Raphael is fortunate if he has access to
the engraving of it by Raphael Morghen.
This engraver, as one learns from the Encyclopædia,
was a Florentine, and executed
this—his most elaborate work—in 1795,
from a drawing of Tofanelli, after having
discovered that a copy he had partly finished
from another drawing, was very inadequate
when compared with the original.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon comparison with engravings by
other artists, it seems to me that this engraving
has not received all the praise it
deserves; I refer especially to the seizing of
the “motives” of the picture, which are so
essential in a work of great scope, to give it
the requisite unity. What the engraver has
achieved in the present instance, I hope to
be able to show in some degree. But one
will not be able to verify my results if he
takes up an engraving by a less fortunate
artist; e.g.: one by Pavoni, of recent
origin.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>II. <span class='fss'>HISTORICAL.</span></h4>
<p class='c005'>It is currently reported that Raphael
painted the “Transfiguration” at the instance
of Cardinal Giulio de Medici, and
that in honor of the latter he introduced
the two saints—Julian and Lawrence—on
the mount; St. Julian suggesting the ill-fated
Giuliano de Medici, the Cardinal’s
father, and St. Lawrence representing his
uncle, “Lorenzo the Magnificent,” the
greatest of the Medici line, and greatest
man of his time in Italy. “The haughty
Michael Angelo refused to enter the lists
in person against Raphael, but put forward
as a fitting rival Sebastian del Piombo, a
Venetian.” Raphael painted, as his masterpiece,
the “Transfiguration,” and Sebastian,
with the help of Michael Angelo,
painted the “Raising of Lazarus.” In
1520, before the picture was quite finished,
Raphael died. His favorite disciple, Giulio
Romano, finished the lower part of the
picture (especially the demoniac) in the
spirit of Raphael, who had completed the
upper portion and most of the lower.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>III. <span class='fss'>LEGEND.</span></h4>
<p class='c005'>The Legend portrayed here—slightly varying
from the one in the New Testament,
but not contradicting it—is as follows:
Christ goes out with his twelve disciples to
Mount Tabor,(?) and, leaving the nine
others at the foot, ascends with the favored
three to the summit, where the scene of
the Transfiguration takes place. While
this transpires, the family group approach
with the demoniac, seeking help from a
miraculous source.</p>

<p class='c006'>Raphael has added to this legend the
circumstance that two sympathetic strangers,
passing that way up the mount, carry
to the Beatified One the intelligence of the
event below, and solicit his immediate and
gracious interference.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Testament account leads us to suppose
the scene to be Mount Tabor, southeast
of Nazareth, at whose base he had
healed many, a few days before, and
where he had held many conversations
with his disciples. “On the following
day, when they were come down, they met
the family,” says Luke; but Matthew and
Mark do not fix so precisely the day.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IV. <span class='fss'>CHARACTERIZATION.</span></h4>
<p class='c005'>It may be safely affirmed that there is
scarcely a picture in existence in which
the individualities are more strongly marked
by internal essential characteristics.</p>

<p class='c006'>Above, there is no figure to be mistaken:
Christ floats toward the source of light—the
Invisible Father, by whom <i>all</i> is made
visible that is visible. On the right, Moses
appears in strong contrast to Elias on the
left—the former the law-giver, and the
latter the spontaneous, fiery, eagle-eyed
prophet.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the mountain top—prostrate beneath,
are the three disciples—one recognizes on
the right hand, John, gracefully bending
his face down from the overpowering light,
while on the left James buries his face in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>his humility. But Peter, the bold one, is
fain to gaze directly on the splendor. He
turns his face up in the act, but is, as on
another occasion, mistaken in his estimate
of his own endurance, and is obliged to
cover his eyes, involuntarily, with his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Below the mount, are two opposed groups.
On the right, coming from the hamlet in
the distance, is the family group, of which
a demoniac boy forms the centre. They,
without doubt, saw Christ pass on his way
to this solitude, and, at length, concluded
to follow him and test his might which had
been “noised abroad” in that region. It
is easy to see the relationship of the whole
group. First the boy, actually “possessed,”
or a maniac; then his father—a man
evidently predisposed to insanity—supporting
and restraining him. Kneeling at the
right of the boy is his mother, whose fair
Grecian face has become haggard with the
trials she has endured from her son. Just
beyond her is her brother, and in the shade
of the mountain, is her father. In the foreground
is her sister. Back of the father,
to the right, is seen an uncle (on the father’s
side) of the demoniac boy, whose
features and gestures show him to be a simpleton,
and near him is seen the face of the
father’s sister, also a weak-minded person.
The parents of the father are not to be
seen, for the obvious reason that old age
is not a characteristic of persons predisposed
to insanity. Again, it is marked
that in a family thus predisposed, some
will be brilliant to a degree resembling genius,
and others will be simpletons. The
whole group at the right are supplicating
the nine disciples, in the most earnest
manner, for relief. The disciples, grouped
on the left, are full of sympathy, but
their looks tell plainly that they can do
nothing. One, at the left and near the
front, holds the books of the Law in his
right hand, but the letter needs the spirit
to give life, and the mere Law of Moses
does not help the demoniac, and only excites
the sorrowful indignation of the
beautiful sister in the foreground.</p>

<p class='c006'>The curious student of the New Testament
may succeed in identifying the different
disciples: Andrew, holding the books
of the Law, is Peter’s brother, and bears a
family resemblance. Judas, at the extreme
left, cannot be mistaken. Matthew looks
over the shoulder of Bartholomew, who is
pointing to the demoniac; while Thomas—distinguished
by his youthful appearance—bends
over toward the boy with a look of
intense interest. Simon (?), kneeling between
Thomas and Bartholomew, is indicating
to the mother, by the gesture with
his left hand, the absence of the Master.
Philip, whose face is turned towards Judas,
is pointing to the scene on the mount,
and apparently suggesting the propriety of
going for the absent one. James, the son
of Alpheus, resembles Christ in features,
and stands behind Jude, his brother, who
points up to the mount while looking at
the father.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>V. <span class='fss'>ORGANIC UNITY.</span></h4>
<p class='c005'>(<i>a</i>) Doubtless every true work of art
should have what is called an “organic unity.”
That is to say, all the parts of the work
should be related to each other in such a
way that a harmony of design arises. Two
entirely unrelated things brought into the
piece would form two centres of attraction
and hence divide the work into two different
works. It should be so constituted
that the study of one part leads to all the
other parts as being necessarily implied in
it. This common life of the whole work
is the central idea which necessitates all
the parts, and hence makes the work an organism
instead of a mere conglomerate or
mechanical aggregate,—a fortuitous concourse
of atoms which would make a chaos
only.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b</i>) This central idea, however, cannot
be represented in a work of art without
contrasts, and hence there must be antitheses
present.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c</i>) And these antitheses must be again
reduced to unity by the manifest dependence
of each side upon the central idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is the central idea of this picture?</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>a</i>) Almost every thoughtful person that
has examined it, has said: “Here is the
Divine in contrast with the Human, and
the dependence of the latter upon the
former.” This may be stated in a variety
of ways. The Infinite is there above, and
the Finite here below seeking it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b</i>) The grandest antithesis is that between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the two parts of the Picture, the
above and the below. The transfigured
Christ, there, dazzling with light; below, the
shadow of mortal life, only illuminated by
such rays as come from above. <i>There</i>, serenity;
and here, rending calamity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then there are minor antitheses.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1) Above we have a Twofold. The
three celestial light-seekers who soar rapturously
to the invisible source of light,
and below them, the three disciples swooning
beneath the power of the celestial vision.
(2) Then below the mountain we
have a similar contrast in the two groups;
the one broken in spirit by the calamity
that “pierces their own souls,” and the
other group powerfully affected by sympathy,
and feeling keenly their impotence
during the absence of their Lord.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again even, there appear other antitheses.
So completely does the idea penetrate
the material in this work of art, that
everywhere we see the mirror of the whole.
In the highest and most celestial we have
the antithesis of Christ and the twain;
Moses the law or letter, Elias the spirit or
the prophet, and Christ the living unity.
Even Christ himself, though comparatively
the point of repose of the whole picture,
is a contrast of soul striving against the
visible body. So, too, the antitheses of
the three disciples, John, Peter, James,—grace,
strength, and humility. Everywhere
the subject is exhaustively treated; the
family in its different members, the disciples
with the different shades of sympathy
and concern. (The maniac boy is a
perfect picture of a being, torn asunder by
violent internal contradiction.)</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c</i>) The unity is no less remarkable.
First, the absolute unity of the piece, is the
transfigured Christ. To it, mediately or
immediately, everything refers. All the
light in the picture streams thence. All the
action in the piece has its motive power in
Him;—first, the two celestials soar to gaze
in his light; then the three disciples are
expressing, by the posture of every limb,
the intense effect of the same light. On
the left, the mediating strangers stand imploring
Christ to descend and be merciful
to the miserable of this life. Below, the
disciples are painfully reminded of Him
absent, by the present need of his all-healing
power, and their gestures refer to his
stay on the mountain top; while the group
at the right, are frantic in supplications for
his assistance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides the central unity, we find minor
unities that do not contradict the higher
unity, for the reason that they are only reflections
of it, and each one carries us, of
its own accord, to the higher unity, and
loses itself in it. To illustrate: Below, the
immediate unity of all (centre of interest)
is the maniac boy, and yet he convulsively
points to the miraculous scene above, and
the perfect unrest exhibited in his attitude
repels the soul irresistibly to seek another
unity. The Christ above, gives us a comparatively
serene point of repose, while
the unity of the Below or finite side of the
picture is an absolute antagonism, hurling
us beyond to the higher unity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before the approach of the distressed
family, the others were intently listening
to the grave and elderly disciple, Andrew,
who was reading and expounding the
Scriptures to them. This was a different
unity, and would have clashed with the
organic unity of the piece; the approach of
the boy brings in a new unity, which immediately
reflects all to the higher unity.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>VI. <span class='fss'>SENSE AND REASON</span> <i>VS.</i> <span class='fss'>UNDERSTANDING</span>.</h4>
<p class='c005'>At this point a few reflections are suggested
to render more obvious, certain
higher phases in the unity of this work of
art, which must now be considered.</p>

<p class='c006'>A work of art, it will be conceded, must,
first of all, appeal to the senses. Equally,
too, its content must be an idea of the Reason,
and this is not so readily granted by
every one. But if there were no idea of
the Reason in it, there would be no unity
to the work, and it could not be distinguished
from any other work <i>not</i> a work
of art. Between the Reason and the Senses
there lies a broad realm, called the “Understanding”
by modern speculative writers.
It was formerly called the “discursive
intellect.” The Understanding applies
the criterion “<i>use</i>.” It does not know
<i>beauty</i>, or, indeed, anything which is
<i>for itself</i>; it knows only what is good for
something else. In a work of art, after it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>has asked what it is good for, it proceeds
to construe it all into prose, for it is the
<i>prose faculty</i>. It must have the picture
tell us what is the <i>external fact</i> in nature,
and not trouble us with any transcendental
imaginative products. It wants imitation
of nature merely.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the artist frequently neglects this
faculty, and shocks it to the uttermost by
such things as the abridged mountain in
this picture, or the shadow cast toward the
sun, that Eckermann tells of.</p>

<p class='c006'>The artist must never violate the sensuous
harmony, nor fail to have the deeper
unity of the Idea. It is evident that the
sensuous side is always cared for by Raphael.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here are some of the effects in the picture
that are purely sensuous and yet
of such a kind that they immediately call
up the idea. The source of light in the
picture is Christ’s form; <i>below</i>, it is reflected
in the garments of the conspicuous
figure in the foreground. Above, is Christ;
opposite and below, a female that suggests
the Madonna. In the same manner Elias,
or the inspired prophet, is the opposite to
the maniac boy; the former inspired by the
<i>celestial</i>; the latter, by the <i>demonic</i>. So
Moses, the law-giver, is antithetic to the
old disciple that has the roll of the Law in
his hand. So, too, in the posture, Elias
floats freely, while Moses is brought against
the tree, and mars the impression of free
self-support. The heavy tables of the Law
seem to draw him down, while Elias seems
to have difficulty in descending sufficiently
to place himself in subordination to
Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even the contradiction that the understanding
finds in the abridgment of the
mountain, is corrected sensuously by the
perspective at the right, and the shade that
the edge of the rock casts which isolates
the above so completely from the below.</p>

<p class='c006'>We see that Raphael has brought them
to a secluded spot just near the top of the
mountain. The view of the distant vale
tells us as effectually that this is a mountain
top as could be done by a full length
painting of it. Hence the criticism rests
upon a misunderstanding of the fact Raphael
has portrayed.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>VII. <span class='fss'>ROMANTIC</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class='fss'>CLASSIC</span>.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Finally, we must recur to those distinctions
so much talked of, in order to introduce
the consideration of the grandest
strokes of genius which Raphael has displayed
in this work.</p>

<p class='c006'>The distinction of Classic and Romantic
Art, of Greek Art from Christian: the former
is characterized by a complete repose, or
equilibrium between the Sense and Reason—or
between matter and form. The
idea seems completely expressed, and the
expression completely adequate to the idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in Christian Art we do not find this
equilibrium; but everywhere we find an
intimation that the idea is too transcendent
for the matter to express. Hence, Romantic
Art is self contradictory—it <i>expresses</i>
the <i>inadequacy</i> of <i>expression</i>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have that within which passeth show;</div>
      <div class='line'>These but the <i>trappings</i> and the <i>suits</i> of woe.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In Gothic Architecture, all strives upward
and seems to derive its support from
above (i. e. the Spiritual, light). All Romantic
Art points to a <i>beyond</i>. The Madonnas
seem to say: “I am a beyond which
cannot be represented in a sensuous form;”
“a saintly contempt for the flesh hovers
about their features,” as some one has expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in this picture, Christ himself, no
more a child in the Madonna’s arms, but
even in his meridian glory, looks beyond,
and expresses dependence on a Being who
is not and cannot be represented. His face
is serene, beatific; he is at unity with this
Absolute Being, but the unity is an internal
one, and his upraised gaze towards the
source of light is a plain statement that the
True which supports him is not a sensuous
one. “God dwelleth not in temples made
with hands; but those who would approach
Him must do it in <i>spirit</i> and in
<i>truth</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the idea which belongs to the
method of all modern Art; but Raphael
has not left this as the general spirit of
the picture merely, but has emphasized it
in a way that exhibits the happy temper of
his genius in dealing with refractory subjects.
And this last point has proved too
much for his critics. Reference is made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>to the two saints painted at the left. How
fine it would be, thought the Cardinal de
Medici, to have St. Lawrence and St. Julian
painted in there, to commemorate my
father and uncle! They can represent
mediators, and thereby connect the two
parts of the picture more closely!</p>

<p class='c006'>Of course, Raphael put them in there!
“Alas!” say his critics, “what a fatal mistake!
What have those two figures to
do there but to mar the work! All for
the gratification of a selfish pride!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Always trust an Artist to dispose of the
Finite; he, of all men, knows how to digest
it and subordinate it to the idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>Raphael wanted just such figures in just
that place. Of course, the most natural
thing in the world that could happen, would
be the ascent of some one to bear the message
to Christ that there was need of him
below. But what is the effect of that upon
the work as a piece of Romantic Art? It
would destroy that characteristic, if permitted
in certain forms. Raphael, however,
seizes upon this incident to show the
entire spiritual character of the upper part
of the picture. The disciples are dazzled
so, that even the firm Peter cannot endure
the light at all. Is this a physical light?
Look at the messengers that have come up
the mountain! Do their eyes indicate anything
bright, not to say dazzling? They
stand there with supplicating looks and
gestures, but see no transfiguration. It
must be confessed, Cardinal de Medici,
that your uncle and father are not much
complimented, after all; they are merely
natural men, and have no inner sense by
which to see the Eternal Verities that illume
the mystery of existence! Even if
you are Cardinal, and they were Popes’
counselors, they never saw anything higher
in Religion than what should add comfort
to us here below!</p>

<p class='c006'>No! The transfiguration, as Raphael
clearly tells us, was a Spiritual one: Christ,
on the mountain with his favored three
disciples, opened up such celestial clearness
in his exposition of the truth, that
they saw Moses and Elias, as it were, combined
in one Person, and a new Heaven
and a new Earth arose before them, and
they were lost in that revelation of infinite
splendor.</p>

<p class='c006'>In closing, a remark forces itself upon
us with reference to the comparative merits
of Raphael and Michael Angelo.</p>

<p class='c006'>Raphael is the perfection of Romantic
Art. Michael Angelo is almost a Greek.
His paintings all seem to be pictures of
statuary. In his grandest—The Last Judgment—we
have the visible presence as the
highest. Art with him could represent the
Absolute. With Raphael it could only, in
its loftiest flights, express its own impotence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whether we are to consider Raphael or
Michael Angelo as the higher artist, must
be decided by an investigation of the merits
of the “Last Judgment.”</p>
<h3 class='c001'>INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY. <br /> CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class='c005'>The object of this series is to furnish,
in as popular a form as possible, a course
of discipline for those who are beginning
the study of philosophy. Strictly <i>popular</i>,
in the sense the word is used—i. e. signifying
that which holds fast to the ordinary
consciousness of men, and does not
take flights beyond—I am well aware, no
philosophy can be. The nearest approach
to it that can be made, consists in starting
from the common external views, and
drawing them into the speculative, step by
step. For this purpose the method of definitions
and axioms, with deductions therefrom,
as employed by Spinoza, is more appropriate
at first, and afterwards a gradual
approach to the <i>Dialectic</i>, or true philosophic
method. In the mathematical method
(that of Spinoza just alluded to) the content
may be speculative, but its form,
never. Hence the student of philosophy
needs only to turn his attention to the
content at first; when that becomes in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>measure familiar, he can then the more
readily pass over to the true form of the
speculative content, and thus achieve complete
insight. A course of discipline in
the speculative content, though under an
inadequate form, would make a grand
preparation for the study of Hegel or
Plato; while a study of these, or, in short,
of any writers who employ speculative
<i>methods</i> in treating speculative <i>content</i>—a
study of these without previous acquaintance
with the content is well nigh
fruitless. One needs only to read the
comments of translators of Plato upon his
speculative passages, or the prevailing
verdicts upon Hegel, to be satisfied on this
point.</p>

<p class='c006'>The course that I shall here present will
embody my own experience, to a great extent,
in the chronological order of its development.
Each lesson will endeavor to
present an <i>aperçu</i> derived from some great
philosopher. Those coming later will presuppose
the earlier ones, and frequently
throw new light upon them.</p>

<p class='c006'>As one who undertakes the manufacture
of an elegant piece of furniture needs
carefully elaborated tools for that end, so
must the thinker who wishes to comprehend
the universe be equipped with the
tools of thought, or else he will come off
as poorly as he who should undertake to
make a carved mahogany chair with no
tools except his teeth and finger nails.
What complicated machinery is required
to transmute the rough ores into an American
watch! And yet how common is the
delusion that no elaboration of tools of
thought is required to enable the commonest
mind to manipulate the highest subjects
of investigation. The alchemy that
turned base metal into gold is only a symbol
of that cunning alchemy of thought
that by means of the philosopher’s stone
(scientific method) dissolves the base <i>facts</i>
of experience into universal truths.</p>

<p class='c006'>The uninitiated regards the philosophic
treatment of a theme as difficult solely by
reason of its technical terms. “If I only
understood your use of words, I think I
should find no difficulty in your thought.”
He supposes that under those bizarre terms
there lurks only the meaning that he and
others put into ordinary phrases. He
does not seem to think that the concepts
likewise are new. It is just as though an
Indian were to say to the carpenter, “I
could make as good work as you, if I only
had the secret of using my finger-nails and
teeth as you do the plane and saw.” Speculative
philosophy—it cannot be too early
inculcated—does <i>not</i> “conceal under cumbrous
terminology views which men ordinarily
hold.” The ordinary reflection would
say that Being is the ground of thought,
while speculative philosophy would say
that thought is the ground of Being;
whether of other being, or of itself as
being—for it is <i>causa sui</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us now address ourselves to the task
of elaborating our technique—the tools of
thought—and see what new worlds become
accessible through our mental telescopes
and microscopes, our analytical scalpels
and psychological plummets.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>I.—A PRIORI AND A POSTERIORI.</h4>
<p class='c005'><i>A priori</i>, as applied to knowledge, signifies
that which belongs to the nature of the
mind itself. Knowledge which is before
experience, or not dependent on it, is <i>a
priori</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>A posteriori</i> or <i>empirical</i> knowledge is
derived from experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>A criterion to be applied in order to test
the application of these categories to any
knowledge in question, is to be found in
<i>universality</i> and <i>necessity</i>. If the truth expressed
has universal and necessary validity
it must be <i>a priori</i>, for it could not have
been derived from experience. Of empirical
knowledge we can only say: “It is
true so far as experience has extended.”
Of <i>a priori</i> knowledge, on the contrary, we
affirm: “It is universally and necessarily
true and no experience of its opposite can
possibly occur; from the very nature of
things it must be so.”</p>
<h4 class='c012'>II.—ANALYTICAL AND SYNTHETICAL.</h4>
<p class='c005'>A judgment which, in the predicate,
adds nothing new to the subject, is said to
be <i>analytical</i>, as e. g. “Horse is an animal;”—the
concept “animal” is already
contained in that of “horse.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Synthetical</i> judgments, on the contrary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>add in the predicate something new to the
conception of the subject, as e. g. “This
rose is red,” or “The shortest distance
between two points is a straight line;”—in
the first judgment we have “red” added
to the general concept “rose;” while in
the second example we have <i>straightness</i>,
which is quality, added to <i>shortest</i>, which
is quantity.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>III.—APODEICTICAL.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Omitting the consideration of <i>a posteriori</i>
knowledge for the present, let us investigate
the <i>a priori</i> in order to learn something
of the constitution of the intelligence
which knows—always a proper subject for
philosophy. Since, moreover, the <i>a priori
analytical</i> (“A horse is an animal”) adds
nothing to our knowledge, we may confine
ourselves, as Kant does, to <i>a priori
synthetical</i> knowledge. The axioms of
mathematics are of this character. They
are universal and necessary in their application,
and we know this without making
a single practical experiment. “Only one
straight line can be drawn between two
points,” or the proposition: “The sum of
the three angles of a triangle is equal to
two right angles,”—these are true in all
possible experiences, and hence transcend
any actual experience. Take any <i>a posteriori</i>
judgment, e. g. “All bodies are
heavy,” and we see at once that it implies
the restriction, “So far as we have
experienced,” or else is a mere analytical
judgment. The <i>universal and necessary</i> is
sometimes called the <i>apodeictical</i>. The
conception of the <i>apodeictical</i> lies at the
basis of all true philosophical thinking.
He who does not distinguish between <i>apodeictic</i>
and <i>contingent</i> judgments must
pause here until he can do so.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IV. SPACE AND TIME.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In order to give a more exhaustive application
to our technique, let us seek the
universal conditions of experience. The
mathematical truths that we quoted relate
to Space, and similar ones relate to
Time. No experience would be possible
without presupposing Time and Space as
its logical condition. Indeed, we should
never conceive our sensations to have an
origin outside of ourselves and in distinct
objects, unless we had the conception of
Space <i>a priori</i> by which to render it possible.
Instead, therefore, of our being
able to generalize particular experiences,
and collect therefrom the idea of Space
and Time in general, we must have added
the idea of Space and Time to our sensation
before it could possibly become an
experience at all. This becomes more clear
when we recur to the <i>apodeictic</i> nature of
Space and Time. Time and Space are
thought as <i>infinites</i>, i. e. they can only be
limited by themselves, and hence are universally
continuous. But no such conception
as <i>infinite</i> can be derived analytically
from an object of experience, for it does
not contain it. All objects of experience
must be <i>within</i> Time and Space, and not
<i>vice versa</i>. All that is limited in extent
and duration presupposes Time and Space
as its logical condition, and this we know,
not from the senses but from the constitution
of Reason itself. “The third side of a
triangle is less than the sum of the two
other sides.” This we never measured, and
yet we are certain that we cannot be mistaken
about it. It is so in all triangles,
present, past, future, actual, or possible.
If this was an inference <i>a posteriori</i>, we
could only say: “It has been found to be
so in all cases that have been measured
and reported to us.”</p>
<h4 class='c012'>V. MIND.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Mind has a certain <i>a priori</i> constitution;
this is our inference. It must be so, or
else we could never have any experience
whatever. It is the only way in which the
possibility of <i>apodeictic</i> knowledge can be
accounted for. What I do not get from
without I must get from within, if I have
it at all. Mind, it would seem from this,
cannot be, according to its nature, a finite
affair—a thing with properties. Were it
limited in Time or Space, it could never
(without transcending itself) conceive Time
and Space as universally continuous or infinite.
Mind is not within Time and Space,
it is as universal and necessary as the
<i>apodeictic</i> judgments it forms, and hence
it is the substantial essence of all that exists.
Time and Space are the logical conditions
of finite existences, and Mind is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>the logical condition of Time and Space.
Hence it is ridiculous to speak of <i>my</i> mind
and <i>your</i> mind, for mind is rather the universal
substrate of all individuality than
owned by any particular individual.</p>

<p class='c006'>These results are so startling to the one
who first begins to think, that he is tempted
to reject the whole. If he does not do
this, but scrutinizes the whole fabric keenly,
he will discover what he supposes to be
fallacies. We cannot anticipate the answer
to his objections here, for his objections
arise from his inability to distinguish
between his imagination and his thinking
and this must be treated of in the next
chapter. Here, we can only interpose an
earnest request to the reader to persevere
and thoroughly refute the whole argument
before he leaves it. But this is only one
and the most elementary position from
which the philosophic traveller sees the
Eternal Verities. Every perfect analysis—no
matter what the subject be—will bring
us to the same result, though the degrees
of concreteness will vary,—some leaving
the solution in an abstract and vague form,—others
again arriving at a complete and
satisfactory view of the matter in detail.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>A DIALOGUE ON IMMORTALITY. <br /> BY ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER. <br /> (Translated from the German, by Chas. L. Bernays.)</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'><i>Philalethes.</i>—I could tell you that, after
your death, you will be what you were previous
to your birth; I could tell you that
we are never born, and that we only seem
to die—that we have always been precisely
the same that we are now, and that we
shall always remain the same—that <i>Time</i>
is the apparatus which prevents us from
being aware of all this; I could tell you
that our consciousness stands always in
the centre of <i>Time</i>—never on one of its
termini; and that any one among us,
therefore, has the immovable centre of
the whole infinite <i>Time</i> in himself. I then
could tell you that those who, by that
knowledge, are assured that the present
time always originates in ourselves, can
never doubt the indestructibility of their
own essence.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thrasymachus.</i>—All of that is too long
and too ambiguous for me. Tell me,
briefly, what I shall be after death.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Phil.</i>—All and nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thras.</i>—There we are! Instead of a solution
to the problem you give me a contradiction;
that is an old trick.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Phil.</i>—To answer transcendental questions
in language that is only made for
immanent perceptions, may in fact lead us
into contradictions.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thras.</i>—What do you mean by “transcendental”
and “immanent” perceptions?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Phil.</i>—Well! <i>Transcendental</i> perception
is rather the knowledge, which, by exceeding
any possibility of experience, tends to
discover the essence of things as they are
by themselves; <i>immanent</i> perception it is,
if it keeps inside of the limits of experience.
In this case, it can only speak of
appearances. You, as an individual, end
with your death. Yet individuality is not
your true and final essence, but only a
mere appearance of it. It is not the <i>thing
in itself</i>, but only its appearance, established
in the form of time, thereby having
a beginning and an end. That which is essential
in you, knows neither of beginning
nor ending, nor of Time itself; it knows
no limits such as belong to a given individuality,
but exists in all and in each. In
the first sense, therefore, you will become
nothing after your death; in the second
sense, you are and remain all. For that
reason I said you would be all and nothing.
You desired a short answer, and I believe
that hardly a more correct answer could be
given <i>briefly</i>. No wonder, too, that it contains
a contradiction; for your life is in
Time, while your immortality is in Eternity.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thras.</i>—Without the continuation of
my individuality, I would not give a farthing
for all your “immortality.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Phil.</i>—Perhaps you could have it even
cheaper. Suppose that I warrant to you
the continuation of your individuality, but
under the condition that a perfectly unconscious
slumber of death for three
months should precede its resuscitation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thras.</i>—Well, I accept the condition.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Phil.</i>—Now, in an absolutely unconscious
condition, we have no measure of
time; hence it is perfectly indifferent
whether, whilst we lie asleep in death in
the unconscious world, three months or
ten thousand years are passing away. We
do not know either of the one or of the
other, and have to accept some one’s word
with regard to the duration of our sleep,
when we awake. Hence it is indifferent
to you whether your individuality is given
back to you after three months or after
ten thousand years.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thras.</i>—That I cannot deny.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Phil.</i>—Now, suppose that after ten
thousand years, one had forgotten to
awake you at all, then I believe that the
long, long state of non-being would become
so habitual to you that your misfortune
could hardly be very great. Certain
it is, any way, that you would know
nothing of it; nay, you would even console
yourself very easily, if you were aware
that the secret mechanism which now keeps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>your actual appearance in motion, had not
ceased during all the ten thousand years
for a single moment to establish and to
move other beings of the same kind.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thras.</i>—In that manner you mean to
cheat me out of my individuality, do you?
I will not be fooled in that way. I have
bargained for the continuation of my individuality,
and none of your motives can
console me for the loss of that; I have it
at heart, and I never will abandon it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Phil.</i>—It seems that you hold individuality
to be so noble, so perfect, so incomparable,
that there can be nothing superior
to it; you therefore would not like to exchange
it for another one, though in that,
you could live with greater ease and perfection.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thras.</i>—Let my individuality be as it
may, it is always myself. It is I—I myself—who
want to be. That is the individuality
which I insist upon, and not such
a one as needs argument to convince me
that it may be my own or a better one.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Phil.</i>—Only look about you! That
which cries out—“I, I myself, wish to exist”—that
is not yourself alone, but all
that has the least vestige of consciousness.
Hence this desire of yours, is just that
which is not individual, but common
rather to all without exception; it does
not originate in individuality, but in the
very nature of existence itself; it is essential
to anybody who lives, nay, it is
that through which it is at all; it seems
to belong only to the individual because
it can become conscious only in the individual.
What cries in us so loud for existence,
does so only through the mediation
of the individual; immediately and
essentially it is the <i>will</i> to exist or to live,
and this <i>will</i> is one and the same in all of
us. Our existence being only the free
work of the will, existence can never fail
to belong to it, as far, at least, as that
eternally dissatisfied will, <i>can</i> be satisfied.
The individualities are indifferent to the
will; it never speaks of them; though it
seems to the individual, who, in himself is
the immediate percipient of it, as if it
spoke only of his own individuality. The
consequence is, that the individual cares
for his own existence with so great
anxiety, and that he thereby secures the
preservation of his kind. Hence it follows
that individuality is no perfection,
but rather a restriction or imperfection;
to get rid of it is not a loss but a gain.
Hence, if you would not appear at once
childish and ridiculous, you should abandon
that care for mere individuality; for
childish and ridiculous it will appear
when you perceive your own essence to be
the universal will to live.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thras.</i>—You yourself and all philosophers
are childish and ridiculous, and in
fact it is only for a momentary diversion
that a man of good common sense ever
consents to squander away an idle hour
with the like of you. I leave your talk for
weightier matters.</p>

<p class='c006'>[The reader will perceive by the positions
here assumed that Schopenhauer has
a truly speculative stand-point; that he
holds self-determination to be the only
substantial (or abiding) reality. But
while Aristotle and those like him have
seized this more definitely as the self-conscious
thinking, it is evident that
Schopenhauer seizes it only from its immediate
side, i. e. as the <i>will</i>. On this
account he meets with some difficulty in
solving the problem of immortality, and
leaves the question of conscious identity
hereafter, not a little obscure. Hegel, on
the contrary, for whom Schopenhauer
everywhere evinces a hearty contempt,
does not leave the individual in any doubt
as to his destiny, but shows how individuality
and universality coincide in self-consciousness,
so that the desire for eternal
existence is fully satisfied. This is the
legitimate result that <i>Philalethes</i> arrives
at in his last speech, when he makes the
individuality a product of the will; for if
the will is the essential that he holds it to
be, and the product of its activity is individuality,
of course individuality belongs
eternally to it. At the close of his <i>Philosophy
of Nature</i>, (Encyclopædia, vol. II.,)
Hegel shows how death which follows life
in the mere animal—and in man as mere
animal—enters consciousness as one of its
necessary elements, and hence does not
stand opposed to it as it does to animal
life. Conscious being (<i>Spirit</i> or <i>Mind</i> as
it may be called,) is therefore immortal
because it contains already, within itself,
its limits or determinations, and thus cannot,
like finite things, encounter dissolution
through external ones.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>GOETHE’S THEORY OF COLORS. <br /> From an exposition given before the St. Louis Philosophical Society, Nov. 2nd, 1866.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>I.—Color arises through the reciprocal
action of light and darkness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>a.</i>) When a light object is seen through
a medium that dims it, it appears of different
degrees of yellow; if the medium is
dark or dense, the color is orange, or approaches
red. Examples: the sun seen in
the morning through a slightly hazy atmosphere
appears yellow, but if the air is
thick with mist or smoke the sun looks red.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b.</i>) On the other hand a dark object,
seen through a medium slightly illuminated,
looks blue. If the medium is very
strongly illuminated, the blue approaches
a light blue; if less so, then indigo; if
still less, the deep violet appears. Examples:
a mountain situated at a great
distance, from which very few rays of light
come, looks blue, because we see it through
a light medium, the air illuminated by the
sun. The sky at high altitudes appears of
a deep violet; at still higher ones, almost
perfectly black; at lower ones, of a faint
blue. Smoke—an illuminated medium—appears
blue against a dark ground, but
yellow or fiery against a light ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c.</i>) The process of bluing steel is a
fine illustration of Goethe’s theory. The
steel is polished so that it reflects light
like a mirror. On placing it in the charcoal
furnace a film of oxydization begins to
form so that the light is reflected through
this dimming medium; this gives a straw
color. Then, as the film thickens, the
color deepens, passing through red to blue
and indigo.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>d.</i>) The prism is the grand instrument
in the experimental field of research into
light. The current theory that light, when
pure, is composed of seven colors, is derived
from supposed actual verifications
with this instrument. The Goethean explanation
is by far the simplest, and, in
the end, it propounds a question which
the Newtonian theory cannot answer without
admitting the truth of Goethe’s theory.</p>

<p class='c006'>II.—The phenomenon of refraction is
produced by interposing different transparent
media between the luminous object
and the illuminated one, in such a manner
that there arises an apparent displacement
of one of the objects as viewed from the
other. By means of a prism the displacement
is caused to lack uniformity; one
part of the light image is displaced more
than another part; several images, as it
were, being formed with different degrees
of displacement, so that they together
make an image whose edges are
blurred in the line of displacement. If
the displacement were perfectly uniform,
no color would arise, as is demonstrated
by the achromatic prism or lens. The
difference of degrees of refraction causes
the elongation of the image into a spectrum,
and hence a mingling of the edges
of the image with the outlying dark surface
of the wall, (which dark surface is
essential to the production of the ordinary
spectrum). Its <i>rationale</i> is the following:</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>a</i>) The light image refracted by the
prism is extended over the dark on one
side, while the dark on the other side is
extended over it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b</i>) The bright over the dark produces
the blue in different degrees. The side
nearest the dark being the deepest or violet,
and the side nearest the light image
being the lightest blue.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c</i>) On the other side, the dark over light
produces yellow in different degrees; nearest
the dark we have the deepest color,
(orange approaching to red) and on the
side nearest the light, the light yellow or
saffron tint.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>d</i>) If the image is large and but little
refracted (as with a water prism) there will
appear between the two opposite colored
edges a colorless image, proving that the
colors arise from the mingling of the light
and dark edges, and not from any peculiar
property of the prism which should “decompose
the ray of light,” as the current
theory expresses it. If the latter theory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>were correct the decomposition would be
throughout, and the whole image be colored.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>e</i>) If the image is a small one, or it is
very strongly refracted, the colored edges
come together in the middle, and the mingling
of the light yellow with the light blue
produces <i>green</i>—a new color which did
not appear so long as the light ground
appeared in the middle.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>f</i>) If the refraction is still stronger,
the edges of the opposite colors lap still
more, and the green vanishes. The Newtonian
theory cannot explain this, but it is
to be expected according to Goethe’s theory.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>g</i>) According to Goethe’s theory, if the
object were a dark one instead of a light
one, and were refracted on a light surface,
the order of colors would be reversed on
each edge of the image. This is the same
experiment as one makes by looking
through a prism at the bar of a window
appearing against the sky. Where in the
light image we had the yellow colors we
should now expect the blue, for now it is
dark over light where before it was light
over dark. So, also, where we had blue
we should now have yellow. This experiment
may be so conducted that the current
doctrine that violet is refracted the
most, and red the least, shall be refuted.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>h</i>) This constitutes the <i>experimentum
crucis</i>. If the prism be a large water prism,
and a black strip be pasted across the middle
of it, parallel with its axis, so that in
the midst of the image a dark shadow intervenes,
the spectrum appears inverted in
the middle, so that the red is seen where
the green would otherwise appear, and
those rays supposed to be the least refrangible
are found refracted the most.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>i</i>) When the two colored edges do not
meet in this latter experiment, we have
blue, indigo, violet, as the order on one
side; and on the other, orange, yellow,
saffron; the deeper colors being next to
the dark image. If the two colored edges
come together the union of the orange with
the violet produces the perfect red (called
by Goethe “<i>purpur</i>”).</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>j</i>) The best method of making experiments
is not the one that Newton employed—that
of a dark room and a pencil of
light—but it is better to look at dark and
bright stripes on grounds of the opposite
hue, or at the bars of a window, the prism
being held in the hand of the investigator.
In the Newtonian form of the experiment
one is apt to forget the importance of the
dark edge where it meets the light.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c014'>SECOND PART OF GOETHE’S FAUST. <br /> [Translated from Rosenkrantz’s “Deutsche Literatur,” by D. J. Snider.]</h3>
<p class='c005'>Goethe began nothing if the whole of the
work did not hover before his mind. By
this determinateness of plan he preserved
a most persevering attachment to the materials
of which he had once laid hold;
they were elements of his existence, which
for him were immortal, because they constituted
his inmost being. He could put
off their execution for years, and still be
certain that his love for them would return,
that his interest in them would animate
him anew. Through this depth of
conception he preserved fresh to the end
his original purpose; he needed not to
fear that the fire of the first enthusiasm
would go out; at the most different times
he could take up his work again with
youthful zeal and strength. Thus in the
circle of his poetical labors, two conceptions
that are in internal opposition to one
another, accompanied him through his
whole life. The one portrays a talented
but fickle man, who, in want of culture, attaches
himself to this person, then to that
one, in order to become spiritually independent.
This struggle carries him into
the breadth of life, into manifold relations
whose spirit he longs to seize and appropriate;
such is Wilhelm Meister. The
other is the picture of an absolutely independent
personality that has cultivated its
lordly power in solitary loftiness, and aspires
boldly to subject the world to itself;
such is Faust. In the development of both
subjects there is a decisive turning-point
which is marked in the first by the “Travels;”
in the second, by the Second Part
of the Tragedy. Up to this point, both in
Wilhelm Meister and in Faust, subjective
conditions prevail, which gradually purify
themselves to higher views and aims. For
the one, the betrothal with Natalia closes
the world of wild, youthful desire; for the
other, the death of Margaret has the
same effect. The one steps into civil society
and its manifold activity, with the
earnest endeavor to comprehend all its elements,
to acquire, preserve, and beautify
property, and to assist in illuminating and
ennobling social relations; the other takes
likewise a practical turn, but from the
summit of Society, from the stand-point
of the State itself. If, therefore, in the
apprenticeship and First Part of the Tragedy,
on account of the excess of subjective
conditions, a closer connection of the
character and a passionate pathos are necessary,
there appears, on the contrary, in the
Travels and Second part of the Tragedy a
thoughtfulness which moderates everything—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>cool designingness; the particular
elements are sharply characterized, but
the personages seem rather as supporters
of universal aims, in the accomplishment
of which their own personality is submerged;
the Universal and its language is
their pathos, and the interest in their history,
that before was so remarkably fascinating,
is blunted of its keenness.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have seen Faust grow, fragment by
fragment, before our eyes. So long as
there existed only a First Part, two views
arose. The one maintained that it was in
this incompleteness what it should be, a
wonderful Torso; that this magnificent
poem only as a fragment could reflect the
World in order to indicate that Man is able
to grasp the Universe in a one-sided, incomplete
manner only; that as the poet touched
the mysteries of the World, but did not
give a complete solution, so the Enigmatical,
the Prophetic, is that which is truly
poetic, infinitely charming, really mystic.
This view was considered as genial, particularly
because it left to every one free
play—in fact, invited every one in his
imagination to fill up the outlines; for
it could not be defended from a philosophic
nor from an artistic standpoint.
Knowing seeks not half knowledge, Art
aims not at halfness of execution. If
Dante in his Divine Comedy had neglected
any element of nature or of history, if he
had not wrought out all with equal perseverance
in corresponding proportion, could
it be said that his poem would stand higher
without this completion? Or conversely,
shall we praise it as a merit that Novalis’
Ofterdingen has remained mere fragments
and sketches? This would be the
same as if we should admire the Cologne
Cathedral less than we now do were it complete.
Another view supposed that a Second
Part was indeed possible, and the
question arose, in what manner shall this
possibility be thought? Here again two
opposite opinions showed themselves. According
to the one, Faust must perish;
reconciliation with God would be unbecoming
to the northern nature of this Titanic
character; the teeth-gnashing defiance,
the insatiate restlessness, the crushing
doubt, the heaven-deriding fierceness,
must send him to hell. In this the spirit
of the old legend was expressed as it was
at the time of the Reformation—for in the
middle ages the redemption of the sinner
through the intercession of the Virgin
Mary first appeared—as the <i>Volksbuch</i> simply
but strikingly narrates it, as the Englishman,
Marlowe, has dramatized it so
excellently in his Doctor Faustus. But all
this was not applicable to the Faust of
Goethe, for the poet had in his mind an
alteration of the old legend, and so another
party maintained that Faust must be saved.
This party also asserted that the indication
of the poet in the Prologue led to
the same conclusion; that God could not
lose his bet against the Devil; that the destruction
of Faust would be blasphemous
irony on Divine Providence. This assertion
of the necessity of Faust’s reconciliation
found much favor in a time, like ours,
which has renounced not indeed the consciousness
and recognition of Evil, but the
belief in a separate extra-human Devil;
which purposes not merely the punishment
but also the improvement of the criminal;
which seeks even to annul the death penalty,
and transfer the atonement for murder
to the inner conscience and to the effacing
power of the Mind. But how was
Poetry to exhibit such a transition from
internal strife to celestial peace? Some
supposed, as Hinrichs, that since Faust’s
despair resulted originally from science,
which did not furnish to him that which it
had at first promised, and since his childish
faith had been destroyed by scepticism,
he must be saved through the scientific
comprehension of Truth, of the Christian
Religion; that speculative Philosophy must
again reconcile him with God, with the
World, and with himself. They confessed
indeed that this process—study and speculation—cannot
be represented in poetry,
and therefore a Second Part of Faust was
not to be expected. Others, especially
poets, took Faust in a more general sense;
he was to penetrate not only Science but
Life in its entirety; the most manifold
action was to move him, and the sweat of
labor was to be the penance which should
bring him peace and furnish the clearness
promised by the Lord. Several sought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>complete the work—all with indifferent
success.</p>

<p class='c006'>In what manner the poet himself would
add a Second Part to the First, what standpoint
he himself would take, remained a secret.
Now it is unsealed; the poem is unrolled
before us complete; with wondering
look we stand before it, with a beating heart
we read it, and with modest anxiety, excited
by a thousand feelings and misgivings,
we venture cursorily to indicate the
design of the great Master; for years shall
pass away before the meaning of the all-comprehensive
poem shall be unveiled
completely in its details. Still this explanation
of particulars in poetry is a subordinate
matter. The main tendency of a
poem must be seen upon its face, and it
would be a sorry work if it did not excite
a living interest the first time that it was
offered to the enjoyment of a people—if
this interest should result from microscopic
explanations and fine unravelling of
concealed allusions—if enthusiasm should
not arise from the poetry as well as from
the learning and acuteness of the poet.
Such particulars, which are hard to understand,
almost every great poem will furnish;
latterly, the explanatory observations
on epic poems have become even
stereotyped; it must be possible to disregard
them; through ignorance of them
nothing essential must be lost.</p>

<p class='c006'>The First Part had shown us Faust in
his still cell, engaged in the study of all
sciences. The results of his investigation
did not satisfy the boundless seeker, and
as an experiment he bound himself to the
Devil to see if the latter could not slake
his burning thirst.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus he rushed into Life. Earthly enjoyment
surrounded him, Love enchained
him, Desire drove him to sudden, to bad
deeds; in the mad <i>Walpurgisnach</i> he
reached the summit of waste worldliness.
But deeper than the Devil supposed, Faust
felt for his Margaret; he desired to save
the unfortunate girl, but he was obliged to
learn that this was impossible, but that
only endurance of the punishment of crime
could restore the harassed mind to peace.
The simple story of love held everything
together here in a dramatic form. The
Prologue in Heaven, the Witch-kitchen,
the <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>, and several contemplative
scenes, could be left out, and there
still would remain a theatrical Whole of
remarkable effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>The relation to Margaret—her death—had
elevated Faust above everything subjective.
In the continuation of his life, objective
relations alone could constitute the
motive of action. The living fresh breath
of the First Part resulted just from this
fact, that everything objective, universal,
was seized from the point of subjective
interest; in the Second Part the Universal,
the Objective, stands out prominently;
subjective interests appear only under the
presupposition of the Objective; the form
becomes allegorical.</p>

<p class='c006'>A story, an action which rounds itself
off to completion, is wanting, and therefore
the dramatic warmth which pulsates
through every scene of the First Part is
no longer felt. The unity which is traced
through the web of the manifold situations,
is the universal tendency of Faust
<i>to create a satisfaction for himself through
work</i>. Mephistopheles has no longer the
position of a being superior by his great
understanding and immovable coldness,
who bitterly mocks Faust’s striving, but
he appears rather as a powerful companion
who skillfully procures the material means
for the aims of Faust, and, in all his activity,
only awaits the moment when Faust
shall finally acknowledge himself to be
satisfied. But the striving of Faust is infinite;
each goal, when once reached, is
again passed by; nowhere does he rest, not
in Society, not in Nature, not in Art, not
in War, not in Industry; only the thought
of Freedom itself, the presentiment of the
happiness of standing with a free people
upon a free soil wrung from the sea, thrills
the old man with a momentary satisfaction—and
he dies. Upon pictures and woodcuts
of the middle ages representations of
dying persons are found, in which the
Devil on one side of the death-bed and angels
on the other await eagerly the departing
soul to pull it to themselves. Goethe
has revived this old idea of a jealousy and
strife between the angels and the Devil for
Man. Mephistopheles, with his horde of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>devils, struggles to carry away the soul of
Faust to hell, but he forgets himself in unnatural
lust, and the angels bear the immortal
part of Faust to that height where
rest and illumination of the dying begin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such an allegorical foundation could not
be developed otherwise than in huge
masses; the division of each mass in itself,
so that all the elements of the thought lying
at the bottom should appear, was the
proper object of the composition. The
First Part could also be called allegorical,
in so far as it reflected the universal Essence
of Spirit in the Individual; but it
could not be said of it in any other sense
than of every poem; Allegory in its stricter
sense was not to be found; the shapes had
all flesh and blood, and no design was felt.
In the Second Part everything passes over
into the really Allegorical, to which Goethe,
the older he grew, seems to have had the
greater inclination; the <i>Xenien</i>, the <i>Trilogie
der Leidenschaft</i>, the <i>Lieder zur Loge</i>,
the <i>Maskenzüge</i>, <i>Epimenides Erwachen</i>, the
cultivation of the Eastern manners, all
proceeded from a didactic turn which delighted
in expressing itself in gnomes, pictures,
and symbolical forms. With wonderful
acuteness, Goethe has always been
able to seize the characteristic determinations,
and unfold them in neat, living language;
however, it lies in the nature of
such poems that they exercise the reflective
faculty more than the heart, and it was
easy to foresee that the Second Part of
Faust would never acquire the popularity
of the First Part; that it would not, as the
latter, charm the nation, and educate the
people to a consciousness of itself, but
that it would always have a sort of esoteric
existence. Many will be repelled by the
mythological learning of the second and
third acts; and the more so, as they do not
see themselves recompensed by the dialectic
of an action; however, we would unhesitatingly
defend the poet against this
reproach; a poem which has to compass
the immeasurable material of the world,
cannot be limited in this respect. What
learning has not Dante supposed in his
readers? Humbly have we sought it, in
order to acquire an understanding of his
poem, in the certainty of being richly rewarded;
the censure which has been cast
upon it for this reason has effected nothing.
Indeed, such fault-finders would here
forget what the first acknowledged Part of
Faust has compelled them to learn. With
this difference of plan, the style must also
change. Instead of dramatic pathos, because
action is wanting, description, explanation,
indication, have become necessary;
and instead of the lively exchange of dialogue,
the lyrical portion has become more
prominent, in order to embody with simplicity
the elements of the powerful world-life.
The descriptions of nature deserve
to be mentioned in particular. The most
wanton fancy, the deepest feeling, the most
accurate knowledge, and the closest observation
into the individual, prevail in all
these pictures with an indescribable charm.
We shall now give a short account of the
contents of each act. In a more complete
exposition we would point out the places
in which the power of the particular developments
centers; in these outlines it is
our design to confine ourselves to tracing
out the universal meaning. To exhibit by
single verses and songs the wonderful
beauty of the language, particularly in the
lyrical portions, would seem to us as superfluous
as the effort to prove the existence
of a divine Providence by anecdotes of
strange coincidences.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first act brings us into social life; a
multitude of shapes pass by us—the most
different wishes, opinions and humors are
heard; still, a secret unity, which we shall
note even more closely, pervades the confused
tumult. In a delightful spot, lying
upon the flowery sward, we see Faust alone,
tormented by deep pangs, seeking rest and
slumber. Out of pure pity, indifferent
whether the unfortunate man is holy or
wicked, elves hover around him and fan
him to sleep, in order that the past may be
sunk into the Lethe of forgetfulness; otherwise,
a continuance of life and endeavor
is impossible. The mind has the power to
free itself from the past, and throw it behind
itself, and treat it as if it had never
been. The secret of renewing ourselves
perpetually consists in this, that we can
destroy ourselves within ourselves, and, as
a veritable Phœnix, be resurrected from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>ashes of self-immolation. Still, this negative
action suffices not for our freedom;
the Positive must be united to us; there
must arise, with “tremendous quaking,”
the sun of new activity and fresh endeavor,
whereby the stillness of nightly repose,
the evanishment of all thoughts and feelings
which had become stable, passes away
in refreshing slumber. Faust awakened,
feels every pulse of nature beating with
fresh life. The glare of the pure sunlight
dazzles him—the fall of waters through
the chasms of the rock depicts to him his
own unrest; but from the sunlight and silvery
vapor of the whirlpool there is created
the richly colored rainbow, which is
always quietly glistening, but is forever
shifting: it is Life. After this solitary
encouragement to new venture and endeavor,
the court of the Emperor receives us,
where a merry masquerade is about to take
place. But first, from all sides, the prosaic
complaints of the Chancellor, the Steward,
the Commander-in-Chief, the Treasurer,
fall upon the ear of the Emperor; money,
the cement of all relations, is wanting to
the State; for commerce, for pleasure, for
luxury, money is the indispensable basis.
At this point, Mephistopheles presses forward
to the place of the old court-fool,
who has just disappeared, and excites the
hope of bringing to light concealed treasure.
To the Chancellor this way seems not
exactly Christian, the multitude raises a
murmur of suspicion, the Astrologer discusses
the possibility—and the proposition
is adopted. After this hopeful prospect,
the masquerade can come off without any
secret anxieties disturbing their merriment.
The nature of the company is represented
in a lively manner. No one <i>is</i> what he
<i>seems</i> to be; each has thrown over himself
a concealing garment; each knows of the
other that he is not that which his appearance
or his language indicates; this effort
to hide his own being, to pretend and to
dream himself into something different
from himself—to make himself a riddle to
others in all openness, is the deepest, most
piquant charm of social interests.</p>

<p class='c006'>The company will have enjoyment—it
unites itself with devotion to the festive
play, and banishes rough egotism, whose
casual outbreaks the watchful herald sharply
reproves; but still, in the heart of every
one, there remains some intention, which
is directed to the accomplishment of earthly
aims. The young Florentine women
want to please; the mother wishes her
daughter to make the conquest of a husband;
the fishermen and bird-catchers are
trying their skill; the wood-chopper, buffoons,
and parasites, are endeavoring, as
well as they can, to make themselves valid;
the drunkard forgets everything over his
bottle; the poets, who could sing of any
theme, drown each other’s voices in their
zeal to be heard, and to the satirist there
scarcely remains an opportunity for a dry
sarcasm. The following allegorical figures
represent to us the inner powers which determine
social life. First, the Graces appear,
for the first demand of society is to
behave with decency; more earnest are the
Parcæ, the continuous change of duration—still,
they work only mechanically; but
the Furies, although they come as beautiful
maids, work dynamically through the
excitement of the passions. Here the aim
is to conquer. <i>Victoria</i> is throned high
upon a sure-footed elephant, which Wisdom
guides with skilful wand, while Fear
and Hope go along on each side; between
these the Deed wavers until it has reached
the proud repose of victory. But as
soon as this happens, the quarrelsome,
hateful Thersites breaks forth, to soil the
glory with his biting sneer. But his derision
effects nothing. The Herald, as the
regulating Understanding, and as distributive
Justice, can reconcile the differences
and mistakes which have arisen, and
he strikes the scoffer in such a manner that
he bursts and turns into an adder and a
bat. Gradually the company returns to its
external foundation; the feeling of <i>Wealth</i>
must secure to it inexhaustible pleasure.
But Wealth is two-fold: the earthly, money—the
heavenly, poetry. Both must be
united in society, if it would not feel weak
and weary. The Boy Driver, that is, Poetry,
which knows how to bring forth the
Infinite in all the relations of life, and
through the same to expand, elevate and
pacify the heart, is acknowledged by Plutus,
the God of common riches, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>one who can bestow that which he himself
is too poor to give. In the proud fullness
of youth, bounding lightly around with a
whip in his hand, the lovely Genius who
rules all hearts, drives with horses of winged
speed through the crowd. The buffoon
of Plutus, lean Avarice, is merrily ridiculed
by the women; Poetry, warned by the
fatherly love of Plutus, withdraws from
the tumult which arises for the possession
of the golden treasures. Gnomes, Giants,
Satyrs, Nymphs, press on with bacchantic
frenzy; earthly desire glows through the
company, and it celebrates great Pan,
Nature, as its God, as the Giver of powerful
Wealth and fierce Lust. A whirling
tumult threatens to seize hold of everybody—a
huge tongue of flame darts over
all; but the majesty of the Emperor, the
self-conscious dignity of man, puts an end
to the juggling game of the half-unchained
Earth-spirit, and restores spiritual self-possession.</p>

<p class='c006'>Still Mephistopheles keeps the promise
which he has made. He succeeds in revivifying
the company by fresh sums of
money, obtained in conformity with his
nature, not by unearthing buried treasures
from the heart of the mountains by means
of the wishing-rod, but by making paper-money!
It is not, indeed, real coin, but
the effect is the same, for in society everything
rests upon the caprice of acceptance;
its own life and preservation are thereby
guaranteed by itself, and its authority,
here represented by the Emperor, has infinite
power. The paper notes, this money
stamped by the airy imagination, spread
everywhere confidence and lively enjoyment.
It is evident that the means of
prosperity have not been wanting, nor
stores of eatables and drinkables, but a
form was needed to set the accumulated
materials in motion, and to weave them
into the changes of circulation. With delight,
the Chancellor, Steward, Commander-in-Chief,
Treasurer, report the
flourishing condition of the army and the
citizens; presents without stint give rise
to the wildest luxury, which extends from
the nobles of the realm down to the page
and fool, and in such joyfulness everybody
can unhesitatingly look about him for
new means of pleasure. Because the company
has its essence in the production of
the notes, its internal must strive for the
artistic; every one feels best when he,
though known, remains unrecognized, and
thus a theatrical tendency developes itself.
For here the matter has nothing to do with
the dramatic as real art, in reference to
the egotism which binds the company together.
The theatre collects the idle multitude,
and it has nothing to do but to see,
to hear, to compare, and to judge. Theatrical
enjoyment surpasses all other kinds
in comfort, and is at the same time the
most varied. The Emperor wishes that
the great magician, Faust, should play a
drama before himself and the court, and
show Paris and Helen. To this design
Mephistopheles can give no direct aid; in
a dark gallery he declares, in conversation
with Faust, that the latter himself must
create the shapes, and therefore must go to
the Mothers. Faust shudders at their
names. Mephistopheles gives him a small
but important key, with which he must enter
the shadowy realm of the Mothers for
a glowing tripod, and bring back the same;
by burning incense upon it, he would be
able to create whatever shape he wished.
As a reason why <i>he</i> is unable to form them,
Mephistopheles says expressly that he is
in the service of big-necked dwarfs and
witches, and not of heroines, and that the
Heathen have their own Hell, with which
he, the Christian and romantic Devil, has
nothing to do. And yet he possesses the
key to it, and hence it is not unknown to
him. And why does Faust shudder at the
names of the Mothers? Who are these
women who are spoken of so mysteriously?
If it were said, the Imagination,
<i>Mothers</i> would be an inept expression; if
it were said, the Past, Present and Future,
Faust’s shuddering could not be sufficiently
accounted for, since how should Time
frighten him who has already lived through
the terrors of Death? From the predicates
which are attached to the Mothers, how
they everlastingly occupy the busy mind
with all the forms of creation; how from
the shades which surround them in thousand-fold
variety, from the Being which is
Nothing, All becomes; how from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>empty, most lonely depth the living existence
comes forth to the surface of Appearance;
from such designations scarcely
anything else can be understood by the
realm of the Mothers than the world of
Pure Thought. This explanation might
startle at the first glance, but we need only
put Idea for Thought—we need only remember
the Idea-world of Plato in order to
comprehend the matter better. The eternal
thoughts, the Ideas, are they not the
still, shadowy abyss, in which blooming
Life buds, into whose dark, agitated depths
it sends down its roots? Mephistopheles
has the key; for the Understanding, which
is negative Determination, is necessary in
order not to perish in the infinite universality
of Thought; it is itself, however,
only the Negative, and therefore cannot
bring the actual Idea, Beauty, to appearance,
but he, in his devilish barrenness,
must hand this work over to Faust; he can
only recommend to the latter moderation,
so as not to lose himself among the phantoms,
and he is curious to know whether
Faust will return. But Faust shudders because
he is not to experience earthly solitude
alone, like that of the boundless
ocean, when yet star follows star, and wave
follows wave; the deepest solitude of the
creative spirit, the retirement into the invisible,
yet almighty Thought, the sinking
into the eternal Idea is demanded of him.
Whoever has had the boldness of this
Thought—whoever has ventured to penetrate
into the magic circle of the Logical,
and its world-subduing Dialectic, into
this most simple element of infinite formation
and transformation, has overcome
all, and has nothing more to fear, as the
Homunculus afterwards expresses it, because
he has beheld the naked essence, because
Necessity has stripped herself to his
gaze. But it is also to be observed that
the tripod is mentioned, for by this there
is an evident allusion to subjective Enthusiasm
and individual Imagination, by which
the Idea in Art is brought out of its universality
to the determinate existence of
concrete Appearance. Beauty is identical
in content with Truth, but its form belongs
to the sphere of the Sensuous.—While
Faust is striving after Beauty, Mephistopheles
is besieged by women in the illuminated
halls, to improve their looks and assist
them in their love affairs. After this
delicate point is settled, no superstition is
too excessive, no sympathetic cure too
strange—as, for example, a tread of the
foot—and the knave fools them until they,
with a love-lorn page, become too much for
him.—Next the stage, by its decorations,
which represents Grecian architecture,
causes a discussion of the antique and romantic
taste; Mephistopheles has humorously
taken possession of the prompter’s
box, and so the entertainment goes on in
parlor fashion, till Faust actually appears,
and Paris and Helen, in the name of the
all-powerful Mothers, are formed from the
incense which ascends in magic power.
The Public indulges itself in an outpouring
of egotistical criticism; the men despise
the unmanly Paris, and interest themselves
deeply in the charms of Helen; the
women ridicule the coquettish beauty with
envious moralizing, and fall in love for the
nonce with the fair youth. But as Paris
is about to lead away Helen, Faust, seized
with the deepest passion for her wonderful
beauty, falls upon the stage and destroys
his own work. The phantoms vanish; still
the purpose remains to obtain Helen; that
is, the artist must hold on to the Ideal, but
he must know that it is the Ideal. Faust
confuses it with common Actuality, and he
has to learn that absolute Beauty is not of
an earthly, but of a fleeting, etherial nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second act brings us away from our
well-known German home to the bottom of
the sea and its mysterious secrets. Faust
is in search of Helen; where else can he
find her, perfect Beauty, than in Greece?
But first he seeks her, and meets therefore
mere shapes, which unfold themselves from
natural existence, which are not yet actual
humanity. Indeed, since he seeks natural
Beauty—for spiritual Beauty he has already
enjoyed in the heavenly disposition of
Margaret—the whole realm of Nature opens
upon us; all the elements appear in succession;
the rocks upon which the earnest
Sphinxes rest, in which the Ants, Dactyls,
Gnomes work, give the surrounding ground;
the moist waters contain in their bosom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the seeds of all things. The holy fire infolds
it with eager flame: according to the
old legend, Venus sprang from the foam of
the sea.—Next we find ourselves at Wittenberg,
in the ancient dwelling, where it is
easy to see by the cob-webs, dried-up ink,
tarnished paper, and dust, that many years
have passed since Faust went out into the
world. Mephistopheles, from the old coat
in which he once instructed the knowledge-seeking
pupil, shakes out the lice and
crickets which swarm around the old master
with a joyful greeting, as also Parseeism
makes Ahriman the father of all vermin.
Faust lies on his bed, sleeps and
dreams the lustful story of Leda, which,
in the end, is nothing more than the most
decent and hence producible representation
of generation. While Mephistopheles in
a humorous, and as well as the Devil can,
even in an idyllic manner, amuses himself,
while he inquires sympathetically after
Wagner of the present Famulus, a pupil
who, in the meanwhile, has become a Baccalaureate,
comes storming in, in order to see
what the master is doing who formerly inculcated
such wise doctrines, and in order
to show what a prodigiously reasonable
man he has himself become. A persiflage
of many expressions of the modern German
Natural Philosophy seems recognizable
in this talk. Despising age, praising
himself as the dawn of a new life, he spouts
his Idealism, by means of which he creates
everything, Sun, Moon and Stars, purely
by the absoluteness of subjective Thought.
Mephistopheles, though the pupil assails
him bitterly, listens to his wise speeches
with lamb-like patience, and after this refreshing
scene, goes into Wagner’s laboratory.
The good man has stayed at home,
and has applied himself to Chemistry, to create,
through its processes, men. To his tender,
humane, respectable, intelligent mind,
the common way of begetting children is too
vulgar and unworthy of spirit. Science must
create man; a real materialism will produce
him. Mephistopheles comes along just at
this time, to whom Wagner beckons silence,
and whispers anxiously to him his undertaking,
as in the glass retort the hermaphroditic
boy, the Homunculus, begins to stir.
But alas! the Artificial requires enclosed
space. The poor fellow can live only in the
glass retort, the outer world is too rough for
him, and still he has the greatest desire to
be actually born. A longing, universal
feeling for natural life sparkles from him
with clear brilliancy, and cousin Mephistopheles
takes him along to the classic
<i>Walpurgisnacht</i>, where Homunculus hopes
to find a favorable moment. Mephistopheles
is related to the little man for this reason,
because the latter is only the product
of nature, because God’s breath has not
been breathed into him as into a real man.</p>

<p class='c006'>After these ironical scenes, the fearful
night of the Pharsalian Fields succeeds,
where the antique world terminated its free
life. This plain, associated with dark remembrances
and bloody shadows, is the
scene of the Classical <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>.
Goethe could choose no other spot, for just
upon this battle-field the spirit of Greek and
Roman antiquity ceased to be a living actuality.
As an external reason, it is well
known that Thessaly was to the ancients
the land of wizards, and especially of
witches, so that from this point of view
the parallel with the German Blocksberg
is very striking. Faust, driven by impatience
to obtain Helen, is in the beginning
sent from place to place to learn her residence,
until Chiron takes him upon the
neck which had once borne that most loving
beauty, and with a passing sneer at the
conjectural troubles of the Philologist, tells
him of the Argonauts, of the most beautiful
man, of Hercules, until he stops his
wild course at the dwelling of the prophetic
Manto, who promises to lead Faust to Helen
on Olympus. Mephistopheles wanders in
the meanwhile among Sphinxes, Griffons,
Sirens, etc. To him, the Devil of the
Christian and Germanic world, this classic
ground is not at all pleasing; he longs for
the excellent Blocksberg of the North, and
its ghostly visages; with the Lamiæ indeed
he resolves to have his own sport, but is
roguishly bemocked; finally, he comes to
the horrible Phorcyads, and after their
pattern he equips himself with one eye and
a tusk for his own amusement; that is, he
becomes the absolutely Ugly, while Faust
is wooing the highest Beauty. In the
Christian world the Devil is also represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>as fundamentally ugly and repulsive;
but he can also, under all forms, appear as
an angel of light. In the Art-world, on
the contrary, he can be known only as the
Ugly. In all these scenes there is a mingling
of the High and the Low, of the Horrible
and the Ridiculous, of vexation and
whimsicality, of the Enigmatical and the
Perspicuous, so that no better contradictions
could be wished for a <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>.
The Homunculus on his part is ceaselessly
striving to come to birth, and betakes himself
to Thales and Anaxagoras, who dispute
whether the world arose in a dry
or wet way. Thales leads the little man to
Nereus, who, however, refuses to aid the
seeker, partly because he has become angry
with men, who, like Paris and Ulysses,
have always acted against his advice, and
partly because he is about to celebrate a
great feast. Afterwards they go to Proteus,
who at first is also reticent, but soon
takes an interest in Homunculus, as he beholds
his shining brilliancy, for he feels
that he is related to the changing fire, and
gives warning that as the latter can become
everything, he should be careful about becoming
a man, for it is the most miserable
of all existences. In the meanwhile, the
Peneios roars; the earth-shaking Seismos
breaks forth with a loud noise; the silent
and industrious mountain-spirits become
wakeful. But always more clearly the
water declares itself as the womb of all
things; the festive train of the Telchines
points to the hoary Cabiri; bewitchingly
resound the songs of the Sirens; Hippocamps,
Tritons, Nereids, Pselli and Marsi
arise from the green, pearl-decked ground;
the throne of Nereus and Galatea arches
over the crystalline depths; at their feet
the eager Homunculus falls to pieces, and
all-moving Eros in darting flames streams
forth. Ravishing songs float aloft, celebrating
the holy elements, which the ever-creating
Love holds together and purifies.
Thales is just as little in the right as Anaxagoras;
together, both are right, for Nature
is kindled to perpetual new life by the
marriage of Fire and Water.</p>

<p class='c006'>The difference between this <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>
and the one in the First Part lies in
the fact, that the principle of the latter is
the relation of Spirit to God. In the
Christian world the first question is, what
is the position of man towards God; therefore
there appear forms which are self-contradictory,
lacerated spiritually, torn
in pieces by the curse of condemnation to
all torture. Classic Life has for its basis
the relation to Nature; the mysterious
Cabiri were only the master-workmen of
Nature. Nature finds in man her highest
goal; in his fair figure, in the majesty of
his form she ends her striving; and therefore
the contradictions of the classic <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>
are not so foreign to Mephistopheles,
who has to do with Good and
Bad, that he does not feel his contact with
them, but still they are not native to him.
The general contradiction which we meet
with, and which also in Mephistopheles
expresses itself by the cloven foot at least,
is the union of the human and animal
frame; the human is at first only half existent,
on earth in Sphinxes, Oreads, Sirens,
Centaurs; in water, in Hippocamps, Tritons,
Nymphs, Dorids, etc. For the fair
bodies of the latter still share the moist
luxuriance of their element. Thus Nature
expands itself in innumerable creations in
order to purify itself in man, in the self-conscious
spirit, in order to pacify and
shut off in him the infinite impulse to formation,
because it passes beyond him to
no new form. He is the embodied image of
God. The inclosed Homunculus, with his
fiery trembling eagerness to pass over into
an independent actuality, is, as it were,
the serio-comic representation of this tendency,
until he breaks the narrow glass,
and now is what he should be, the union
of the elements, for this is Eros according
to the most ancient Greek conception, as
we still find even in the Philosophers.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the third act Goethe has adhered to
the old legend, according to which, Faust,
by means of Mephistopheles, obtained Helen
as a concubine, and begat a son, Justus
Faustus. Certainly, the employment of
this feature was very difficult; and still,
even in our days, a poet, L. Bechstein, in
his Faust, has been wrecked upon this rock.
He has Helen marry Faust; they beget a
child; but finally, when Faust makes his
will, and turns away unlovingly from wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and child, it is discovered that the Grecian
Helen, who in the copperplates is also costumed
completely in the antique manner,
is a German countess of real flesh and
blood, who has been substituted by the
Devil; an undeceiving which ought to excite
the deepest sympathy. Goethe has
finely idealized this legend; he has expressed
therein the union of the romantic
and classic arts. The third act, this Phantasmagory,
is perhaps the most perfect of
all, and executed in the liveliest manner.
As noble as is the diction of the first and
second acts, especially in the lyrical portions,
it is here nevertheless by far surpassed.
Such a majesty and simplicity, such
strength and mildness, unity and variety,
in so small a space, are astonishing. First
resounds the interchange of the dignity of
Æschylus and Sophocles, with the sharp-steeled
wit of Aristophanes; then is heard
the tone of the Spanish romances, an agreeable,
iambic measure, a sweet, ravishing
melody; finally, new styles break forth,
like the fragments of a prophecy; ancient
and modern rhythms clash, and the harmony
is destroyed.—Helen returns, after the
burning of Troy, to the home of her spouse,
Menelaus; the stewardess, aged, wrinkled,
ugly, but experienced and intelligent,
Phorcyas, receives her mistress in the citadel
by command. Opposed to Beauty, as
was before said, Mephistopheles can only
appear as ugliness, because in the realm
of beautiful forms, the Ugly is the
Wicked. There arises a quarrel between
the graceful, yet pretentious youth of the
Chorus, and world-wise, yet stubborn Old
Age. Helen has to appease it, and she
learns with horror from Phorcyas that
Menelaus is going to sacrifice her.—Still,
(as on the one hand Grecian fugitives, after
the conquest of Constantinople, instilled
everywhere into German Life the taste
for classic Beauty, and as, on the other
hand, one of the Ottomans in Theophania—like
Faust—won a Helen, and thereby
everywhere arose a striving after the appropriation
of the Antique,) the old stewardess
saves her, and bears her through
the air together with her beautiful train,
to the Gothic citadel of Faust, where the
humble and graceful behavior of the iron
men towards the women, in striking contrast
to their hard treatment on the banks
of the Eurotas, at once wins the female
heart. The watchman of the tower, Lynceus,
lost in wondering delight over the
approaching beauty, forgets to announce
her, and has brought upon himself a heavy
punishment; but Helen, the cause of his
misdemeanor, is to be judge in his case,
and she pardons him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Faust and all his vassals do homage to
the powerful beauty, in whom the antique
pathos soon disappears. In the new surroundings,
in the mutual exchange of quick
and confiding love, the sweet rhyme soon
flows from their kissing lips. An attack of
Menelaus interrupts the loving courtship;
but Valor, which in the battle for Beauty
and favor of the ladies, seeks its highest
honor and purport, is unconquerable, and
the swift might of the army victoriously
opposes Menelaus. Christian chivalry protects
the jewel of beauty which has fled to
it for safety, against all barbarism pressing
on from the East.—Thus the days of the
lovers pass rapidly away in secret grottoes
amid pastoral dalliance; as once Mars refreshed
himself in the arms of Venus, so
in the Middle Ages knights passed gladly
from the storm of war to the sweet service
of women in quiet trustfulness. Yet the
son whom they beget, longs to free himself
from this idle, Arcadian life. The nature
of both the mother and the father drives
him forward, and soon consummates the
matter. Beautiful and graceful as Helen,
the insatiate longing for freedom glows in
him as in Faust. He strikes the lyre with
wonderful, enchanting power; he revels
wildly amid applauding maidens; he rushes
from the bottom of the valley to the tops
of the mountains, to see far out into the
world, and to breathe freely in the free
air. His elastic desire raises him, a second
Icarus, high in the clouds; but he soon
falls dead at the feet of the parents, while
an aureola, like a comet, streaks the Heavens.
Thus perished Lord Byron. He is a
poet more romantic than Goethe, to whom,
however, Art gave no final satisfaction, because
he had a sympathy for the sufferings
of nations and of mankind, which called
him pressingly to action. His poems are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>full of this striving. In them he weeps
away his grief for freedom. Walter Scott,
who never passed out of the Middle Ages,
is read more than Byron. But Byron is
more powerful than he, because the Idea
took deeper root, and that demoniacal
character concentrated in itself all the
struggles of our agitated time. Divine
poesy softened not the wild sorrow of his
heart, and the sacrifice of himself for the
freedom of a beloved people and land
could not reproduce classic Beauty. The
fair mother, who evidently did not understand
the stormy, self-conscious character
of her son, sinks after him into the lower
world. As everything in this phantasmagory
is allegorical, I ask whether this can
mean anything else than that freedom is
necessary for beauty, and beauty also for
freedom? Euphorion is boundless in his
striving; the warnings of the parents avail
not. He topples over into destruction.
But Helen, i.e. Beauty, cannot survive
him, for all beauty is the expression of
freedom, of independence, although it does
not need to know the fact. Only Faust,
who unites all in himself, who strives to
reach beyond Nature and Art, Present and
Past, that is, the knowing of the True,
survives her; upon her garments, which
expand like a cloud, he moves forth.
What remains now, since the impulse of
spiritual Life, the clarification of Nature
in Art, the immediate spiritual Beauty,
have vanished? Nothing but Nature in
her nakedness, whose choruses of Oreads,
Dryads and Nymphs swarm forth into the
mountains, woods and vineyards, for bacchantic
revelry; an invention which belongs
to the highest effort of all poetry.
It is a great kindness in the Devil, when
Phorcyas at last discloses herself as
Mephistopheles, and where there is need,
offers herself as commentator.</p>

<p class='c006'>The life of Art, of Beauty, darkens like
a mist; upon the height of the mountain,
Faust steps out of the departing cloud, and
looks after it as it changes to other forms.
His restless mind longs for new activity.
He wants to battle with the waters, and
from them win land; that is, the land shall
be his own peculiar property, since he
brings it forth artificially. As that money
which he gave to the Emperor was not
coined from any metal, but was a product
of Thought; as that Beauty which charmed
him was sought with trouble, and wrung
from Nature, and as he, seizing the sword
for the protection of Beauty, exchanged
Love for the labor of chivalry,—so the land,
the new product of his endeavor, not yet
is, but he will first create it by means
of his activity. A war of the Emperor
with a pretender gives him an opportunity
to realize his wish. He supports the Emperor
in the decisive battle. Mephistopheles
is indifferent to the Right and to
freedom; the material gain of the war is
the principal thing with him; so he takes
along the three mighty robbers, Bully,
Havequick and Holdfast. (See 2d Samuel,
23: 8.) The elements must also fight—the
battle is won—and the grateful Emperor
grants the request of Faust to leave the
sea-shore for his possession. The State is
again pacified by the destruction of the
pretender; a rich booty in his camp repays
many an injury; the four principal offices
promise a joyful entertainment; but the
Church comes in to claim possession of the
ground, capital and interest, in order that
the Emperor may be purified from the guilt
of having had dealings with the suspicious
magician. Humbly the Emperor promises
all; but as the archbishop demands tithe
from the strand of the sea which is not
yet in existence, the Emperor turns away
in great displeasure. The boundless rapacity
of the Church causes the State to
rise up against it. This act has not the
lyrical fire of the previous ones; the action,
if the war can thus be called, is diffuse;
the battle, as broad as it is, is without
real tension; the three robbers are
allegorically true, if we look at the meaning
which they express, but are in other
respects not very attractive. In all the
brilliant particulars, profound thoughts,
striking turns, piquant wit, and wise arrangement,
there is still wanting the living
breath, the internal connection to exhibit
a complete picture of the war. And still,
from some indications, we may believe
that this tediousness is designed, in order
to portray ironically the dull uniformity,
the spiritual waste of external political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>life, and the littleness of Egotism. For it
must be remembered that the war is a civil
war—the genuine poetic war, where people
is against people, falls into Phantasmagory.
The last scene would be in this respect
the most successful. The continued
persistency of the spiritual lord to obtain
in the name of the heavenly church, earthly
possessions, the original acquiescence of
the Emperor, but his final displeasure at
the boundless shamelessness of the priest,
are excellently portrayed, and the pretentious
pomp of the Alexandrine has never
done better service.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the fifth act we behold a wanderer,
who is saved from shipwreck, and brought
to the house of an aged couple, Philemon
and Baucis. He visits the old people, eats
at their frugal table, sees them still happy
in their limited sphere, but listens with astonishment
to them, as they tell of the
improvements of their rich neighbor, and
they express the fear of being ousted by
him. Still, they pull the little bell of
their chapel to kneel and pray with accustomed
ceremony in presence of the ancient
God.—The neighbor is Faust. He has
raised dams, dug canals, built palaces, laid
out ornamental gardens, educated the people,
sent out navies. The Industry of our
time occupies him unceasingly; he revels
in the wealth of trade, in the turmoil of
men, in the commerce of the world. That
those aged people still have property in the
middle of his possessions is extremely
disagreeable to him, for just this little spot
where the old mossy church stands, the
sound of whose bell pierces his heart,
where the airy lindens unfold themselves
to the breeze, he would like to have as a
belvedere to look over all his creations at
a glance. Like a good man whose head is
always full of plans, he means well to the
people, and is willing to give them larger
possessions where they can quietly await
death, and he sends Mephistopheles to treat
with them. But the aged people, who care
not for eating and drinking, but for comfort,
will not leave their happy hut; their
refusal brings on disputes, and the dwelling,
together with the aged couple and the
lindens, perishes by fire in this conflict between
the active Understanding and the
poetry of Feeling, which, in the routine of
pious custom, clings to what is old. Faust
is vexed over the turn which affairs have
taken, particularly over the loss of the
beautiful lindens, but consoles himself
with the purpose to build in their stead a
watch-tower. Then before the palace, appear
in the night, announcing death, four
hoary women, Starvation, Want, Guilt and
Care, as the Furies who accompany the external
prosperity of our industrial century.
Still, Care can only press through the
key-hole of the chamber of the rich man,
and places herself with fearful suddenness
at his side. The Negative of Thought is
to be excluded by no walls. But Faust immediately
collects himself again; with impressive
clearness he declares his opinion
of life, of the value of the earthly Present;
Care he hates, and does not recognize
it as an independent existence. She will
nevertheless make herself known to him
at the end of his life, and passes over his
face and makes him blind. Still, Faust
expresses no solicitude, though deprived of
his eyes by Care; no alteration is noticed
in him, he is bent only upon his aims; the
energy of his tension remains uniform:
Spirit, Thought, is the true eye; though
the external one is blinded, the internal
one remains open and wakeful. The transition
from this point to the conclusion is
properly this: that from the activity of
the finite Understanding, only a Finite can
result. All industry, for whose development
Mephistopheles is so serviceable, as
he once was in war, cannot still the hunger
of Spirit for Spirit. Industry creates only
an aggregate of prosperity, no true happiness.
Our century is truly great in industrial
activity. But it should only be the
means, the point of entrance for real freedom,
which is within itself the Infinite.
And Faust has to come to this, even on the
brink of the grave. Mephistopheles, after
this affair with Care, causes the grave of
the old man to be dug by the shaking Lemures.
Faust supposes, as he hears the
noise of the spades, that his workmen are
busily employed. Eagerly he talks over
his plans with Mephistopheles, and at last
he glows at the good fortune of standing
upon free ground with a free people. Daily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>he feels that man must conquer Freedom
and Life anew, and the presentiment
that the traces of his uninterrupted striving
would not perish in the Ages, is the
highest moment of his whole existence.
This confession of satisfaction kills him,
and he falls to the earth dead. After trying
everything, after turning from himself
to the future of the race, after working
unceasingly, he has ripened to the acknowledgement
that the Individual only in
the Whole, that Man only in the freedom
of humanity can have repose. Mephistopheles
believes that he has won his bet,
causes the jaws of Hell to appear, and
commands the Devils to look to the soul of
Faust. But Angels come, strewing roses
from above; the roses, the flowers of Love,
cause pain where they fall; the Devils and
Mephistopheles himself complain uproariously.
He lashes himself with the falling
roses, which cling to his neck like pitch
and brimstone, and burn deeper than Hell-fire.
First, he berates the Angels as hypocritical
puppets, yet, more closely observed,
he finds that they are most lovely
youths. Only the long cloaks fit them too
modestly, for, from behind particularly, the
rascals had a very desirable look. While
he is seeking out a tall fellow for himself,
and is plunged wholly in his pederastic
lust, the Angels carry away the immortal
part of Faust to Heaven. Mephistopheles
now reproaches himself with the greatest
bitterness, because he has destroyed,
through so trivial a desire, the fruits
of so long a labor. This <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>
of the Devil must be considered as
one of the happiest strokes of humor. The
holy innocence of the Angels is not for
him; he sees only their fine bodies; his
lowness carries him into the Unnatural and
Accidental, just where his greatest interest
and egotism come in play. This result
will surprise most people; but if they consider
the nature of the Devil, it will be
wholly satisfactory; in all cunning he is
at last bemocked as a fool, and he destroys
himself through himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>In conclusion, we see a woody, rocky
wilderness, settled with hermits. It is not
Heaven itself, but the transition to the
same, where the soul is united to perfect
clearness and  happiness. Hence we find
the glowing devotion and repentance of
the <i>Pater ecstaticus</i>, the contemplation of
the <i>Pater profundus</i>, the wrestling of the
<i>Pater serapticus</i>, who, taking into his eyes
the holy little boys because their organs
are too weak for the Earth, shows them
trees, rocks, waterfalls. The Angels bring
in Faust, who, as Doctor Marianus, in the
highest and purest cell, with burning prayer
to the approaching queen of Heaven, seeks
for grace. Around Maria is a choir of
penitents, among whom are the Magna
Peccatrix, the Mulier Samaritana, and Maria
Ægyptiaca. They pray for the earthly
soul; and one of the penitents, once called
Margaret, kneeling, ventures a special intercession.
The Mater Gloriosa appoints
Margaret to lead the soul of Faust to
higher spheres, for he shall follow her
in anticipation. A fervent prayer streams
from the lips of Doctor Marianus; the
Chorus mysticus concludes with the assurance
of the certainty of bliss through
educating, purifying love. Aspiration, the
Eternal feminine, is in Faust, however
deeply he penetrates into every sphere of
worldly activity. The analogy between
Margaret and the Beatrice of Dante is
here undeniable; also, the farther progress
of Faust’s life we must consider similar,
as he, like Dante, grows in the knowledge
and feeling of the Divine till he arrives at
its complete intuition; Dante beholds the
Trinity perfectly free and independent,
without being led farther by anybody.
From this point of view, that the poet
wanted to exhibit reconciliation as becoming,
as a product of infinite growth, is
found the justification of the fact that he
alludes so slightly to God the Father, and
to Christ the Redeemer, and, instead,
brings out so prominently the worship of
the Virgin, and the devotion of Woman.
Devotion has a passive element which finds
its fittest poetical support in women.
These elements agree also very well with
the rest of the poem, since Goethe, throughout
the entire drama, has preserved the
costume of the Middle Ages; otherwise, on
account of the evident Protestant tendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>of Faust, it would be difficult to find a necessary
connection with the other parts of
the poem.</p>

<p class='c006'>As regards the history of Faust in itself,
dramatically considered, the first four acts
could perhaps be entirely omitted. The
fifth, as it shows us that all striving, if its
content is not religion, (the freedom of the
Spirit,) can give no internal satisfaction, as
it shows us that in the earnest striving after
freedom, however much we may err,
still the path to Heaven is open, and is only
closed to him who does not strive, would
have sufficiently exhibited the reconciliation.
But Goethe wants to show not only
this conclusion, which was all the legend
demanded of him, but also the becoming
of this result. Faust was for him and
through him for the nation, and indeed for
Europe, the representative of the world-comprehending,
self-conscious internality
of Spirit, and therefore he caused all the
elements of the World to crystallize around
this centre. Thus the acts of the Second
Part are pictures, which, like frescoes, are
painted beside one another upon the same
wall, and Faust has actually become what
was so often before said of him, a perfect
manifestation of the Universe.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we now cast a glance back to what we
said in the beginning, of the opposition
between the characters of Wilhelm Meister
and Faust, that the former was <i>the determined
from without</i>, the latter <i>the self-determining
from within</i>, we can also seize
this opposition so that Meister is always in
pursuit of Culture, Faust of Freedom.
Meister is therefore always desirous of
new impressions, in order to have them
work upon himself, extend his knowledge,
complete his character. His capacity and
zeal for Culture, the variety of the former,
the diligence of the latter, forced him to
a certain tameness and complaisance in relation
to others. Faust on the contrary
will himself work. He will possess only
what he himself creates. Just for this reason
he binds himself to the Devil, because
the latter has the greatest worldly power,
which Faust applies unsparingly for his
own purposes, so that the Devil in reality
finds in him a hard, whimsical, insatiate
master. To Wilhelm the acquaintance of
the Devil would indeed have been very interesting
from a moral, psychological and
æsthetic point of view, but he never would
have formed a fraternity with him. This
<i>autonomia</i> and <i>autarkia</i> of Faust have given
a powerful impulse to the German people,
and German literature. But if, in the
continuation of Faust, there was an expectation
of the same Titanic nature, it was
disappointed. The monstrosity of the tendencies
however, does not cease; a man
must be blind not to see them. But in the
place of pleasure, after the catastrophe
with Margaret, an active participation in
the world enters; a feature which Klinger
and others have retained. But Labor in
itself can still give no satisfaction, but its
content, too, must be considered. Or rather,
the external objectivity of Labor is indifferent;
whether one is savant, artist,
soldier, courtier, priest, manufacturer,
merchant, etc., is a mere accident; whether
he wills Freedom or not, is not accidental,
for Spirit is in and for itself, free.
With the narrow studio, in fellowship with
Wagner, Faust begins; with Trade, with
contests about boundaries, with his look
upon the sea, which unites the nations, he
ends his career.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the World, Freedom indeed realizes
itself, but as absolute, it can only come
to existence in God.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is therefore right when Goethe makes
the transition from civil to religious freedom.
Men cannot accomplish more than
the realization of the freedom of the nations,
for Mankind has its concrete existence
only in the nations; if the nations
are free, it is also free. Faust must thus
be enraptured by this thought in the highest
degree. But with it, he departs from
the world—Heaven has opened itself above
him. But, though Heaven sheds its grace,
and lovingly receives the striving soul
which has erred, still it demands repentance
and complete purification from what
is earthly. This struggle, this wrestling
of the soul, I find expressed in the most
sublime manner in the songs of the hermits
and the choruses, and do not know what
our time has produced superior in spiritual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>power, as well as in unwavering hope,
though I must confess that I am not well
enough versed in the fertile modern lyric
literature of Pietism, to say whether such
pearls are to be found in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, it is evident that the pliable
Meister, and the stubborn Faust, are the
two sides which were united in Goethe’s
genius. He was a poet, and became a
courtier; he was a courtier, and remained
a poet. But in a more extensive sense this
opposition is found in all modern nations,
particularly among the Germans. They
wish to obtain culture, and therefore shun
no kind of society if they are improved.
But they wish also to be free. They love
culture so deeply that they, perhaps, for a
while, have forgotten freedom. But then
the Spirit warns them. They sigh, like
Faust, that they have sat so long in a
gloomy cell over Philosophy, Theology,
etc. With the fierceness of lions, they
throw all culture aside for the sake of
freedom, and in noble delusion form an
alliance—even with the Devil.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>A CRITICISM OF PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS. <br /> [Translated from the German of J. G. Fichte, by A. E. Kroeger.]</h3>
<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Note.</span> Below we give to our readers the translation of another Introduction to the Science
of Knowledge, written by Fichte immediately after the one published in our previous number.
Whereas that first Introduction was written for readers who have as yet no philosophical system
of their own, the present one is intended more particularly for those who have set philosophical
notions, of which they require to be disabused.—<span class='sc'>Editor.</span>]</p>

<p class='c010'>I believe the first introduction published
in this Journal to be perfectly sufficient
for unprejudiced readers, i. e. for readers
who give themselves up to the writer without
preconceived opinions, who, if they do
not assist him, also do not resist him in
his endeavors to carry them along. It is
otherwise with readers who have already a
philosophical system. Such readers have
adopted certain maxims from their system,
which have become fundamental principles
for them; and whatsoever is not produced
according to these maxims, is now pronounced
false by them without further investigation,
and without even reading such
productions: it is pronounced false, because
it has been produced in violation of
their universally valid method. Unless
this class of readers is to be abandoned
altogether—and why should it be?—it is,
above all, necessary to remove the obstacle
which deprives us of their attention;
or, in other words, to make them distrust
their maxims.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a preliminary investigation concerning
the <i>method</i>, is, above all, necessary
in regard to the Science of Knowledge,
the whole structure and significance whereof
differs utterly from the structure and
significance of all philosophical systems
which have hitherto been current. The
authors of these previous systems started
from some conception or another; and utterly
careless whence they got it, or out of
what material they composed it, they then
proceeded to analyze it, to combine it with
others, regarding the origin whereof they
were equally unconcerned; and this their
argumentation itself is their philosophy.
Hence their philosophy consists in <i>their
own</i> thinking. Quite different does the
Science of Knowledge proceed. That
which this Science makes the object of its
thinking, is not a dead conception, remaining
passive under the investigation, and
receiving life only from it, but is rather
itself living and active; generating out
of itself and through itself cognitions,
which the philosopher merely observes
in their genesis. His business in the
whole affair is nothing further than to place
that living object of his investigation in
proper activity, and to observe, grasp and
comprehend this its activity as a Unit.
He undertakes an experiment. It is his
business to place the object in a position
which permits the observation he wishes
to make; it is his business to attend to all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the manifestations of the object in this
experiment, to follow them and connect
them in proper order; but it is not his
business to <i>cause</i> the manifestations in the
object. That is the business of the object
itself: and he would work directly contrary
to his purpose if he did not allow the
object full freedom to develop itself—if
he undertook but the least interference in
this, its self-developing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The philosopher of the first mentioned
sort, on the contrary, does just the reverse.
He produces a product of art. In working
out his object he only takes into consideration
its matter, and pays no attention to
an internal self-developing power thereof.
Nay, this power must be deadened before
he undertakes his work, or else it might
resist his labor. It is from the dead matter,
therefore, that he produces something,
and solely by means of his own power, in
accordance with his previously resolved-upon
conception.</p>

<p class='c006'>While thus in the Science of Knowledge
there are two utterly distinct series of
mental activity—that of the Ego, which
the philosopher observes, and that of the
observations of the philosopher—all other
philosophical systems have only <i>one</i> series
of thinking, viz: that of the thoughts of
the philosopher, for his object is not introduced
as thinking at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the chief grounds of so many
objections to and misunderstandings of
the Science of Knowledge lies in this:
that these two series of thinking have not
been held apart, or that what belonged to
the one has been taken to belong to the
other. This error occurred because Philosophy
was held to consist only of one
series. The act of one who produces a
work of art is most certainly—since his
object is not active—the appearance itself;
but the description of him who has undertaken
an experiment, is not the appearance
itself, but the conception thereof.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>After this preliminary remark, the further
application whereof we shall examine
in the course of our article, let us now
ask: how does the Science of Knowledge
proceed to solve its problem?</p>

<p class='c006'>The question it will have to answer, is,
as we well know, the following: Whence
comes the system of those representations
which are accompanied by the feeling of
necessity? Or, how do we to come claim
objective validity for what is only subjective?
Or, since objective validity is generally
characterized as <i>being</i>, how do we come
to accept a being? Now, since this question
starts from a reflection that returns into
itself—starts from the observation, that the
immediate object of consciousness is after
all merely consciousness itself,—it seems
clear enough that the question can speak
of no other being than of a being for us.
It would be indeed a complete contradiction,
to mistake it for a question concerning
some being which had no relation to
our consciousness. Nevertheless, the philosophers
of our philosophical age are of
all things most apt to plunge into such absurd
contradictions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The proposed question, how is a being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>for us possible? abstracts itself from all
being; i. e. it must not be understood, as
if the question posited a not-being; for
in that case the conception of being would
only be negated, but not abstracted from.
On the contrary, the question does not
entertain the conception of being at
all, either positively or negatively. The
proposed question asks for the ground of
the predicate of being, whether it be applied
positively or negatively; but all
ground lies beyond the grounded, i. e. is
opposed to it. The answer must, therefore,
if it is to be an answer to this question,
also abstract from all being. To maintain,
<i>a priori</i>, in advance of an attempt,
that such an abstraction is impossible in
the answer, because it is impossible in itself,
would be to maintain likewise, that
such an abstraction is impossible in the
question; and hence, that the question
itself is not possible, and that the problem
of a science of metaphysics, as the science
which is to solve the problem of the ground
of being for us, is not a problem for human
reason.</p>

<p class='c006'>That such an abstraction, and hence
such a question, is contrary to reason,
cannot be proven by objective grounds to
those who maintain its possibility; for
the latter assert that the possibility and
necessity of the question is grounded upon
the highest law of reason—that of self-determination,
(Practical legislation,) under
which all other laws of reason are
subsumed, and from which they are all
derived, but at the same time determined
and limited to the sphere of their validity.
They acknowledge the arguments of their
opponents willingly enough, but deny their
application to the present case; with what
justice, their opponents can determine
only by placing themselves upon the
basis of this highest law, but hence, also,
upon the basis of an answer to the disputed
question, by which act they would cease to
be opponents. Their opposition, indeed,
can only arise from a subjective defect—from
the consciousness that they never
raised this question, and never felt the
need of an answer to it. Against this
their position, no objective grounds can,
on the other hand, be made valid, by those
who insist on an answer to the question;
for the doubt, which raises that question,
is grounded upon previous acts of freedom,
which no demonstration can compel
from any one.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>III.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Let us now ask: Who is it that undertakes
the demanded abstraction from all
being? or, in which of the two series does
it occur? Evidently, in the series of philosophical
argumentation, for another series
does not exist.</p>

<p class='c006'>That, to which the philosopher holds,
and from which he promises to explain all
that is to be explained, is the consciousness,
the subject. This subject he will,
therefore, have to comprehend free from
all representation of being, in order first
to show up in it the ground of all being—of
course, for itself. But if he abstracts
from all being of and for the subject,
nothing pertains to it but an acting. Particularly
in relation to being is it the acting.
The philosopher will, therefore, have
to comprehend it in its acting, and from
this point the aforementioned double series
will first arise.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fundamental assertion of the philosopher,
as such, is this: as soon as the Ego
is for itself, there necessarily arises for it
at the same time an external being; the
ground of the latter lies in the former;
the latter is conditioned by the former.
Self-consciousness and consciousness of a
Something which is not that Self, is necessarily
united; but the former is the
conditioning and the latter the conditioned.
To prove this assertion—not, perhaps,
by argumentation, as valid for a system of
a being in itself, but by observation of
the original proceeding of reason, as valid
for reason—the philosopher will have to
show, firstly, how the Ego is and becomes
for itself; and secondly, that this its own
being for itself is not possible, unless at
the same time there arises for it an external
being, which is not it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first question, therefore, would be:
how is the Ego for itself? and the first
postulate: think thyself! construe the
conception of thyself, and observe how
thou proceedest in this construction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The philosopher affirms that every one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>who will but do so, must necessarily discover
that in the thinking of that conception,
his activity, as intelligence, returns
into itself, makes itself its own object.</p>

<p class='c006'>If this is correct and admitted, the manner
of the construction of the Ego, the
manner of its being for itself, (and we
never speak of another being,) is known;
and the philosopher may then proceed to
prove that this act is not possible without
another act, whereby there arises for the
Ego an external being.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is thus, indeed, that the Science of
Knowledge proceeds. Let us now consider
with what justice it so proceeds.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IV.</h4>
<p class='c005'>First of all: what in the described act
belongs to the philosopher, as philosopher,
and what belongs to the Ego he is to
observe? To the Ego nothing but the return
to itself; everything else to the description
of the philosopher, for whom, as
mere fact, the system of all experience,
which in its genesis the Ego is now to produce
under his observation, has already
existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Ego returns <i>into itself</i>, is the assertion.
Has it not then already being in
advance of this return into itself, and independently
thereof? Nay, must it not
already be for itself, if merely for the possibility
of making itself the object of its
action? Again, if this is so, does not the
whole philosophy presuppose what it ought
first to explain?</p>

<p class='c006'>I answer by no means. First through
this act, and only by means of it—by means
of an acting upon an acting—does the Ego
<i>originally</i> come to be <i>for itself</i>. It is only
<i>for the philosopher</i> that it has previous
existence as a fact, because the philosopher
has already gone through the whole experience.
He must express himself as he does,
to be but understood, and he can so express
himself, because he long since has
comprehended all the conceptions necessary
thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, to return to the observed Ego:
what is this its return into itself? Under
what class of modifications of consciousness
is it to be posited? It is no <i>comprehending</i>,
for a comprehending first arises
through the opposition of a non-Ego, and
by the determining of the Ego in this opposition.
Hence it is a mere <i>contemplation</i>.
It is therefore not consciousness,
not even self-consciousness. Indeed, it is
precisely because this act alone produces no
consciousness, that we proceed to another
act, through which a non-Ego originates
for us, and that a progress of philosophical
argumentation and the required deduction
of the system of experience becomes possible.
That act only places the Ego in
the possibility of self-consciousness—and
thus of all other consciousness—but does
not generate real consciousness. That
act is but a part of the whole act of the
intelligence, whereby it effects its consciousness;
a part which only the philosopher
separates from the whole act, but
which is not originally so separated in the
Ego.</p>

<p class='c006'>But how about the philosopher, as such?
This self-constructing Ego is none other
than his own. He can contemplate that
act of the Ego only in himself, and, in order
to contemplate it, must realize it. He
produces that act arbitrarily and with
freedom.</p>

<p class='c006'>But—this question may and has been
raised—if your whole philosophy is erected
upon something produced by an act
of mere arbitrariness, does it not then
become a mere creature of the brain, a
pure imaginary picture? How is the philosopher
going to secure to this purely subjective
act its objectivity? How will he
secure to that which is purely empirical
and a moment of time—i. e. the time in
which the philosopher philosophizes—its
originality? How can he prove that his
present free thinking in the midst of the
series of his representations does correspond
to the necessary thinking, whereby
he first became for himself, and through
which the whole series of his representations
has been started?</p>

<p class='c006'>I answer: this act is in its nature objective.
I am for myself; this is a fact.
Now I could have thus come to be for myself
only through an act, for I am free;
and only through this thus determined act,
for only through it do I become for myself
every moment, and through every other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>act something quite different is produced.
That acting, indeed, is the very conception
of the Ego; and the conception of the
Ego is the conception of that acting; both
conceptions are quite the same; and that
conception of the Ego can mean and can
not be made to mean anything, but what
has been stated. <i>It is so</i>, because <i>I make
it so</i>. The philosopher only makes clear
to himself what he really thinks and has
ever thought, when he thinks or thought
<i>himself</i>; but that he does think himself is
to him immediate fact of consciousness.
That question, concerning the objectivity is
grounded on the very curious presupposition
that the Ego is something else than
its own thought of itself, and that something
else than this thought and outside
of it—God may know what they do mean!—is
again the ground of it, concerning
the actual nature of which outside something
they are very much troubled. Hence
if they ask for such an objective validity
of the thought, or for a connection between
this object and the subject, I cheerfully
confess that the Science of Knowledge can
give them no instruction concerning it. If
they choose to, they may themselves enter,
in this or any other case, upon the discovery
of such a connection, until they, perhaps,
will recollect that this Unknown
which they are hunting, is, after all, again
their thought, and that whatsoever they
may invent as its ground, will also be their
thought, and thus <i>ad infinitum</i>; and
that, indeed, they cannot speak of or question
about anything without at the same
time thinking it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, in this act, which is arbitrary and
in time, for the philosopher as such, but
which is for the Ego—which he constructs,
by virtue of his just deduced right, for the
sake of subsequent observations and
conclusions—necessarily and originally; in
this act, I say, the philosopher looks at
himself, and immediately contemplates
his own acting; he knows what he does,
because <i>he does it</i>. Does a consciousness
thereof arise in him? Without doubt; for
he not only contemplates, but <i>comprehends</i>
also. He comprehends his act, as an <i>acting
generally</i>, of which he has already a
conception by virtue of his previous experience;
and as this <i>determined</i>, into itself <i>returning</i>
acting, as which he contemplates
it in himself. By this characteristic determination
he elevates it above the sphere
of <i>general acting</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>What</i> acting may be, can only be <i>contemplated</i>,
not developed from and through
conceptions; but that which this contemplation
contains is <i>comprehended</i> by the
mere opposition of pure <i>being</i>. Acting is
not being, and being is not acting. Mere
conception affords no other determination
for each link; their real essence is only
discovered in contemplation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now this whole procedure of the philosopher
appears to <i>me</i>, at least, very possible,
very easy, and even natural; and I
can scarcely conceive how it can appear
otherwise to my readers, and how they
can see in it anything mysterious and
marvellous. Every one, let us hope, can
think <i>himself</i>. He will also, let us hope,
learn that by being required to thus think
himself he is required to perform an act,
dependent upon his own activity, an internal
act; and that if he realizes this demand,
if he really affects himself through
self-activity, he also most surely <i>acts</i> thus.
Let us further hope that he will be able to
distinguish this kind of acting from its
<i>opposite</i>, the acting whereby he thinks
external objects, and that he will find in
the latter sort of thinking the thinking
and the thought to be opposites, (the activity,
therefore, tending upon something
distinct from itself,) while in the former
thinking both were one and the same, (and
hence the activity a return into itself.)
He will comprehend, it is to be hoped,
that—since the thought of himself arises
<i>only</i> in this manner, (an opposite thinking
producing a quite different thought)—the
thought of himself is nothing but the
thought of this act, and the word Ego
nothing but the designation of this act—that
Ego and an <i>into itself returning activity</i>
are completely identical conceptions. He
will understand, let us hope, that if he but
for the present problematically presupposes
with transcendental Idealism that all
consciousness rests upon and is dependent
upon self-consciousness, he must also
<i>think</i> that return into itself as preceding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and conditioning all other acts of consciousness;
indeed as the primary act of
the subject; and, since there is nothing for
him which is not in his consciousness,
and since everything else in his consciousness
is conditioned by this act, and therefore
cannot condition the act in the same
respect,—as an act, utterly unconditioned
and hence absolute <i>for him</i>; and he will
thus further understand, that the <i>above
problematical presupposition</i> and this <i>thinking
of the Ego as originally posited through
itself</i>, are again quite identical; and that
hence transcendental Idealism, if it proceeds
systematically, can proceed in no
other manner than it does in the Science of
Knowledge.</p>

<p class='c006'>This contemplation of himself, which is
required of the philosopher, in his realization
of the act, through which the Ego
arises for him, I call <i>intellectual contemplation</i>.
It is the immediate consciousness
that I act and what I act; it is that through
which I know something, because I do it.
That there is such a power of intellectual
contemplation cannot be demonstrated by
conceptions, nor can conception show what
it is. Every one must find it immediately
in himself, or he will never learn to know
it. The requirement that we ought to
show <i>it</i> what it is by argumentation, is
more marvellous than would be the requirement
of a blind person, to explain to
him, without his needing to use sight,
what colors are.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it can be certainly proven to everyone
in his own confessed experience, that
this intellectual contemplation does occur
in every moment of his consciousness. I
can take no step, cannot move hand or
foot, without the intellectual contemplation
of my self-consciousness in these acts;
only through this contemplation do I know
that <i>I</i> do it, only through it do I distinguish
my acting and in it myself from the
given object of my acting. Everyone who
ascribes an activity to himself appeals to
this contemplation. In it is the source of
life, and without it is death.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this contemplation never occurs
alone, as a complete act of consciousness,
as indeed sensuous contemplation also
never occurs alone nor completes consciousness;
both contemplations must be
<i>comprehended</i>. Not only this, but the intellectual
contemplation is also always
connected with a <i>sensuous</i> contemplation.
I cannot find myself acting without finding
an object upon which I act, and this object
in a sensuous contemplation which I comprehend;
nor without sketching an image
of what I intend to produce by my act,
which image I also comprehend. Now, then,
how do I know and how can I know what I
intend to produce, if I do not immediately
contemplate myself in this sketching of
the image which I intend to produce, i. e.
in this sketching of the conception of my
<i>purpose</i>, which sketching is certainly an
act. Only the totality of this condition
in uniting a given manifold completes
consciousness. I become conscious only
of the conceptions, both of the object
upon which I act, and of the purpose I intend
to accomplish; but I do not become
conscious of the contemplations which are
at the bottom of both conceptions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps it is only this which the zealous
opponents of intellectual contemplation
wish to insist upon; namely, that that
contemplation is only possible in connection
with a sensuous contemplation; and
surely the Science of Knowledge is not
going to deny it. But this is no reason
why they should deny intellectual contemplation.
For with the same right we might
deny sensuous contemplation, since it also
is possible only in connection with intellectual
contemplation; for whatsoever is
to become <i>my</i> representation must be related
to me, and the consciousness (I)
occurs only through intellectual contemplation.
(It is a remarkable fact of our
modern history of philosophy, that it has
not been noticed as yet how all that may
be objected to intellectual contemplation
can also be objected to sensuous contemplation,
and that thus the arguments of its
opponents turn against themselves.)</p>

<p class='c006'>But if it must be admitted that there is
no immediate, isolated consciousness of
intellectual contemplation, how does the
philosopher arrive at a knowledge and
isolated representation thereof? I answer,
doubtless in the same manner in which he
arrives at the isolated representation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>sensuous contemplation, by drawing a conclusion
from the evident facts of consciousness.
This conclusion runs as follows:
I propose to myself, to think this or that,
and the required thought arises; I propose
to myself, to do this or that, and the representation
that it is being done arises.
This is a fact of consciousness. If I look
at it by the light of the laws of mere sensuous
consciousness, it involves no more
than has just been stated, i. e. a sequence
of certain representations. I become conscious
only of this <i>sequence</i>, in a series of
time movements, and only such a time sequence
can I assert. I can merely state—I
know that if I propose to myself a certain
thought, with the characteristic that
it is to have existence, the representation
of this thought, with the characteristic
that it really has existence, follows; or,
that the representation of a certain manifestation,
as one which ought to occur, is
immediately followed in time by the representation
of the same manifestation as one
which really did occur. But I can, on no
account, state that the first representation
contains the <i>real</i> ground of the second one
which followed; or, that by thinking the
first one the second one <i>became real</i> for me.
I merely remain passive, the placid scene
upon which representations follow representations,
and am, on no account, the active
principle which produces them. Still
I constantly assume the latter, and cannot
relinquish that assumption without relinquishing
my self. What justifies me in it?
In the sensuous ingredients I have mentioned,
there is no ground to justify such
an assumption; hence it is a peculiar and
immediate consciousness, that is to say, a
contemplation, and not a sensuous contemplation,
which views a material and permanent
being, but a contemplation of a
pure activity, which is not permanent but
progressive, not a being but a life.</p>

<p class='c006'>The philosopher, therefore, discovers
this intellectual contemplation as fact of
consciousness, (for him it is a fact; for
the original Ego a fact and act both together—a
deed-act,) and he thus discovers
it not immediately, as an isolated part of
his consciousness, but by distinguishing
and separating what in common consciousness
occurs in unseparated union.</p>

<p class='c006'>Quite a different problem it is to explain
this intellectual contemplation, which is
here presupposed as fact, in its <i>possibility</i>,
and by means of this explanation to defend
it against the charge of deception
and deceptiveness, which is raised by dogmatism;
or, in other words, to prove the
<i>faith</i> in the reality of this intellectual contemplation,
from which faith transcendental
idealism confessedly starts—by a something
still higher; and to show up the
interest which leads us to place faith in
its reality, or in the system of Reason.
This is accomplished by showing up the
<i>Moral Law</i> in us, in which the Ego is
characterized as elevated through it above
all the original modifications, as impelled
by an absolute, or in itself, (in the Ego,)
grounded activity; and by which the Ego
is thus discovered to be an absolute Active.
In the consciousness of this law, which
doubtless is an immediate consciousness,
and not derived from something else, the
contemplation of self-activity and freedom
is grounded. <i>I am given to myself through
myself as something, which is to be active
in a certain manner; hence, I am given to
myself through myself as something active
generally; I have the life in myself, and
take it from out of myself. Only through
this medium of the Moral Law do I see</i> <span class='fss'>MYSELF</span>;
<i>and if I see myself through that law,
I necessarily see myself as self-active</i>; and
it is thus that there arises in a consciousness—which
otherwise would only be the
consciousness of a sequence of my representations—the
utterly foreign ingredient
of an <i>activity of myself</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This intellectual contemplation is the
only stand-point for all Philosophy. From
it all that occurs in consciousness may be
explained, but only from it. Without self-consciousness
there is no consciousness at
all; but self-consciousness is only possible
in the way we have shown, i. e. I am only
active. Beyond it I cannot be driven; my
philosophy then becomes altogether independent
of all arbitrariness, and a product
of stern necessity; i. e. in so far as necessity
exists for free Reason; it becomes a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>product of <i>practical</i> necessity. I <i>can</i> not
go beyond this stand-point, because conscience
says I <i>shall</i> not go beyond it; and
thus transcendental idealism shows itself
up to be the only moral philosophy—the
philosophy wherein speculation and moral
law are intimately united. Conscience
says: I <i>shall</i> start in my thinking from
the pure Ego, and shall think it absolutely
self-active; not as determined by the
things, but as determining the things.</p>

<p class='c006'>The conception of activity which becomes
possible only through this intellectual
contemplation of the self-active Ego,
is the only one which unites both the
worlds that exist for us—the sensuous and
the intelligible world. Whatsoever is opposed
to my activity—and I must oppose
something to it, for I am finite—is the
sensuous, and whatsoever is to arise
through my activity is the intelligible
(moral) world.</p>

<p class='c006'>I should like to know how those who
smile so contemptuously whenever the
words “intellectual contemplation” is
mentioned, think the consciousness of the
moral law; or how they are enabled to
entertain such conceptions as those of
Virtue, of Right, &amp;c., which they doubtless
do entertain. According to them there are
only two contemplations <i>a priori</i>—Time
and Space. They surely form these conceptions
of Virtue, &amp;c., in Time, (the form
of the inner sense,) but they certainly do
not hold them to be time itself, but merely
a certain filling up of time. What is it,
then, wherewith they fill up time, and get
a basis for the construction of those conceptions?
There is nothing left to them
but Space; and hence their conceptions of
Virtue, Right, &amp;c., are perhaps quadrangular
and circular; just as all the other conceptions
which they construct, (for instance,
that of a tree or of an animal,) are
nothing but limitations of Space. But
they do not conceive their Virtue and
their Right in this manner. What, then,
is the basis of their construction? If
they attend properly, they will discover
that this basis is activity in general, or
freedom. Both of these conceptions of
virtue and right are to them certain limitations
of their general activity, exactly as
their sensuous conceptions are limitations
of space. How, then, do they arrive at
this basis of their construction? We
will hope that they have not derived activity
from the dead permanency of matter,
nor freedom from the mechanism of
nature. They have obtained it, therefore,
from immediate contemplation, and thus
they confess a third contemplation besides
their own two.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is, therefore, by no means so unimportant,
as it appears to be to some, whether
philosophy starts from a fact or from a
deed-act, (i. e. from an activity, which presupposes
no object, but produces it itself,
and in which, therefore, the <i>acting</i> is immediately
<i>deed</i>.) If philosophy starts
from a fact, it places itself in the midst
of being and finity, and will find it difficult
to discover therefrom a road to the
infinite and super-sensuous; but if it
starts from a deed-act, it places itself at
once in the point which unites both worlds
and from which both can be overlooked at
one glance.</p>

<p class='c006'>[Translators frequently use the term
“intuition” for what I have here called
“contemplation;” “Deed-Act” is my rendering
of “That-Handlung.” A. E. K.]</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>NOTES ON MILTON’S LYCIDAS. <br /> BY ANNA C. BRACKETT.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Every work of art, whether in sculpture,
painting, or music, must have a definite
content; and only in having such has it
any claim to be so called. This content
must be spiritual; that is, it must come
from the inner spirit of the artist, and
translate itself by means of the work into
spirit in the spectator or listener. Only
in the recognition of this inner meaning
which lives behind the outside and shimmers
through it, can consist the difference
between the impression made on me by
the sight of a beautiful painting, and
that produced on an inferior animal, as
the retina of his eye paints with equal
accuracy the same object. For what
is this sense of beauty which thrills
through me, while the dog at my side looks
at the same thing and sees nothing in seeing
all which the eye can grasp? Is it not
the response in me to the informing spirit
behind all the outward appearance?</p>

<p class='c006'>But if this sense of beauty stops in passive
enjoyment, if the sense of sight or of
hearing is simply to be intoxicated with
the feast spread before it, we must confess
that our appreciation of beauty is a very
sensuous thing. Content though some
may be, simply to enjoy, in the minds of
others the fascination of the senses only
provokes unrest. We say with Goethe:
“I would fain understand that which interests
me in so extraordinary a manner;”
for this work of art, the product of mind,
touches me in a wonderful way, and must
be of universal essence. Let me seek the
reason, and if I find it, it will be another
step towards “the solvent word.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in a true work of art this content
must be essentially <i>one</i>; that is, one profound
thought to which all others, though
they may be visible, must be gracefully
subordinate; otherwise we are lost in a
multiplicity of details, and miss the unity
which is the sole sign of the creative mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nor need we always be anxious as to
whether the artist consciously meant to
say thus and so. Has there ever lived a
true artist who has not “builded better
than he knew”? If this were not so, all
works of art would lose their significance
in the course of time. Are the half-uttered
meanings of the statues of the Egyptian
gods behind or before us to-day? Do
they not perplex us with prophecies rather
than remembrances as we wander amazed
among them through the halls of the British
Museum? A whole nation striving to
say the one word, and dying before it was
uttered! Have we heard it clearly yet?</p>

<p class='c006'>The world goes on translating as it gains
new words with which to carry on the
work. It is not so much the artist that is
before his age as the divine afflatus guiding
his hand which leads not only the age but
him. Through that divine inspiration he
speaks, and he says mysterious words
which perhaps must wait for centuries to
be understood. In that fact lies his right
to his title; in that, alone, lies the right of
his production to be called a work of art.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doubtless all readers are familiar with
Dr. Johnson’s criticisms on Milton’s Lycidas,
and these we might pass by without
comment, for it would evidently be as impossible
for Dr. Johnson’s mind to comprehend
or be touched by the poetry of Lycidas
as for a ponderous sledge-hammer
to be conscious of the soft, perfume-laden
air through which it might move. The
monody is censured by him because of its
irregularly recurring rhymes, and in the
same breath we are told that it is so full
of art that the author could not have felt
sorrow while writing it. We know how
intricately the rhymes are woven in Milton’s
sonnets, where he seems to have taken
all pains to select the most difficult arrangements,
and to carry them through without
deviation, and we say only that the first
criticism contradicts the last. But some
more appreciative critics, while touched by
the beauty, repeat the same, and say there
is “more poetry than sorrow” in the poem.
More poetry than sorrow! Sorrow is the
grand key note, and strikes in always over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and through all the beauty and poetry like
a wailing chord in a symphony, that is
never absent long, and ever and anon
drowns out all the rest. Sorrow, pure and
simple, is the thread on which all the
beautiful fancies are strung. It runs
through and connects them all, and there
is not a paragraph in the whole poem that
is not pierced by it. It is the occasion,
the motive, the inner inspiration, and the
mastery over it is the conclusion of all.
Around it, the constant centre, group themselves
all the lovely pictures, and they all
face it and are subordinate to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The soul of the poet is so tossed by the
immediate sorrow that it surrenders itself
entirely to it, and so, losing its will, is
taken possession of by whatever thought,
evoked by the spell of association, rises in
his mind; as when he speaks of Camus
and St. Peter. Ever and anon the will
makes an effort to free itself and to determine
its own course, but again and
again the wave of sorrow sweeps up, and
the vainly struggling will goes down before
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing lay closer to Milton’s heart
than the interests of what he believed the
true church; and nothing touched him
more than the abuses which were then
prevalent in the church of England. In
the safe harbor of his father’s country
home, resting on his oars before the appointed
time for the race in which he was
to give away all his strength and joy, surrounded
and inspired by the fresh, pure
air from the granite rocks of Puritanism,
all his growing strength was gathering its
energies for the struggle. This just indignation
and honest protest must find
its way in the poem through the grief
that sweeps over him, and which, because
so deep, touches and vivifies all his
deepest thoughts. But even that strong
under current of conviction has no power
long to steady him against the wave of
sorrow which breaks above his head, none
the less powerful because it breaks in a
line of white and shivers itself into
drops which flash diamond colors in
the warm and pure sunlight of his cultured
imagination. More poetry than sorrow?
Then there is more poetry in Lycidas
than in any other poem of the same
length in our language.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be impossible here to go through
the poem with the close care to all little
points which is necessary to enable one
fully to comprehend its exquisite beauty
and finish. It is like one of Beethoven’s
symphonies, where at first we are so occupied
with the one grand thought that
we surrender ourselves entirely to it, and
think ourselves completely satisfied. But
as we appropriate that more and more
fully, within and around it wonderful melodies
start and twine, and this experience
is repeated again and again till the music
seems almost infinite in its content. Let
us, then, briefly go over the burden of the
monody, our chief effort being to show how
perfectly at one it is throughout, how natural
the seemingly abrupt changes,—only
pausing now and then to speak of some
special beauty which is so marked that one
cannot pass it by in silence. If we succeed
in showing a continued and natural
thought in the whole and a satisfactory
solution for the collision which gives rise
to the poem, our end will have been accomplished.</p>

<p class='c006'>Milton begins in due order by giving, as
prelude, his reason for singing. But he
has written only seven full lines before,
in the eighth, the key-note is struck by
the force of sorrow, which, after saying
“Lycidas is dead,” lingers on the strain
and repeats, to heighten the grief, “dead
ere his prime.” The next line, the ninth,
is still more pathetic in its echoing repetition
and its added cause for mourning. (In
passing, let us say that the effect is greatly
increased in reading this line if the first
word be strongly emphasized.) Because he
hath not left his peer, all should sing for
him. No more excuse is needed. Sorrow
pleases itself in calling up the neglected
form, and then passionately turns to the
only solace that it can have—“Some melodious
tear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This, of course, brings the image of
the Muses, and as that thought comes,
once more we have a new attempt at a
formal beginning in the second paragraph
(line 15). First, is the invocation, and
then, recurring to the first thought, Milton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>says it is peculiarly appropriate for <i>him</i>
to sing of Lycidas. Why? Because they
had been so long together, and as the
thought of happier things arises, the sweet
memories, linked by the chain of association,
come thronging so tumultuously that
he forgets himself in reverie. The music,
at first slow and sweet, grows more and
more strong and rapid till even the rustic
dance-measure comes in merrily. Most
naturally here the key-note is again struck
by the force of contrast, and the despair
of the sorrow that wakes from the forgetfulness
of pleasant dreams to the consciousness
of loss, strikes as rapidly its
minor chords till it seems as if hope were
entirely lost.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing is more unreasonable than this
despair of sorrow. Tossed in its own wild
passion, it sees nothing clearly, and seeking
for some adequate cause, heaps blindly
unmerited reproaches on anything, on
all things. So, recoiling before its power,
stung with its pain, the poet turns reproachfully
to the nymphs, blaming them
for their negligence. But before the
words are fairly uttered he realizes his
folly. Lycidas was beloved by them, but
if Calliope could not save even her own
son, how powerless are they against the
step of inevitable fate! This strikes deep
down in the thunder of the bass notes, and
the thought comes which perhaps cannot
be more powerfully expressed than by the
old Hebrew refrain, “Vanity of vanities,
all is vanity.” After all, why seek for
anything, even for fame? Man’s destiny
is ruled by irresponsible necessity. Life
is worth nothing, and would it not be better,
instead of “scorning delights and living
laborious days,” to yield one’s self to
the pleasures of the passing moment? “All
is vanity and vexation of spirit.” When
any soul reaches this point, it seems as if
help must come from outside of itself or
it will go irrevocably down. Sorrow, despair,
are always represented by darkness.
Is it an accident that the celestial notes
which first strike through the descending
bass, come from the god of light, Phœbus
Apollo? Clear, and sweet, and sudden,
they cleave the closing shadows, the sunlight
comes in again, and the music climbs
up and grows serenely steady.</p>

<p class='c006'>Relieved from this Inferno the soul
comes once more to self-consciousness,
and in its effort to guide itself, what more
natural than that it should recur to the idea
expressed in the fiftieth line, and attempt
to make something like order by carrying
out that idea. Reason takes command,
and the strain flows smoothly, till, by the
exercise of her power, the true cause of
the misfortune is recognized and a just
indignation (line 100) takes its place. But
in yielding to this, the immediate feeling
regains possession, reason resigns her
sway, and the soul is set afloat again on
the uncertain sea of association. See how
sudden and sweet the transition from fiery
reproach and invective to the gentlest tenderness,
in line 102. It begins with a
thunder peal and dies out in a wail of affection,
expressed by the one word “sacred.”
This forms the connection between
this paragraph and the next, a delicate yet
perfect link, for as all his love overflows
in that one word, the old happier days
come up again; and where should these
memories carry him but to the university
where they had found so much common
pleasure and inspiration. Here the sorrow,
before entirely personal, becomes
wider as the singer feels that others grieve
with him for lost talent and power.</p>

<p class='c006'>Were they not both destined for the
church for which their university studies
were only a preparation? Most naturally
the subtle chain of association brings up
the thought of the great apostle with the
keys of heaven and hell. How sorely the
church needed true teachers! The earnest
spirit that was ready to assail every
form of wrong, eagerly followed out the
thought which was in the future to burn
into its very life. From line 113 to line
131 notice the succession of feelings. A
sense of irreparable loss—indignation—mark
the <i>three</i> words, “creep,” “intrude,”
and “climb,” no one of which could be
spared. Then comes disgust, expressed
by “Blind mouths.” Ruskin, in his
“Kings’ Treasures,” very happily observes
that no epithet could be more sweeping
than this, for as the office of a bishop is to
oversee the flock, and that of a pastor to
feed it, the utter want of all qualification
for the sacred office is here most forcibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>expressed. Contempt follows; then pity
for those who, desiring food, are fed only
with wind; detestation of the secret and
corrupt practices of the Romish church;
and finally hope, coming through the possible
execution of Archbishop Laud, whose
death, it seemed to the young Puritan,
was the only thing needed to bring back
truth, simplicity and safety. Drifting with
these emotions the singer has followed the
lead of his fancies, and just as before,
when light came with healing for his despair,
Hope recalls him to himself, till he
returns again in line 132, as in line 85, to
the regular style of his poem. He is as
one who, waking from wildering dreams,
collects his fugitive thoughts, and tries to
settle them down for the necessary routine
of the day. A more regular and plainly
accented strain, recognized as heard before,
comes into the music, as he pleases
himself in fancying that the sad consolation
is still left him of ornamenting the
hearse. It is useless to speak of the exquisite
finish of these lines, or of how
often one word, as “fresh” for instance,
in line 138, calls up before the mind such
pictures that one lingers and lingers over
the passage, as the poet’s fancy in vain
effort lingered, striving to forget his sorrow.
This strain comes in like some of
the repeating melodies in the second part
of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, where it
seems as if the soul had found a new,
sweet thought, and was turning it over
and over as loth to pause, and as in sudden
hope of some relief through its potency.
But the heavy key-note strikes
again through it all, in line 154, with a
crash that drowns all the sweetness and
beauty. We hear the rush of the cruel,
insatiate sea, as its waves dash against
the shore of the stormy Hebrides, and the
conflict of wave and wind takes possession
of us. What thought is more desolate
than that of a solitary human form, tossed
hither and thither in the vast immensity
of ocean! Perhaps, even now, it floats by
“the great vision of the guarded mount.”
It seems to the poet that all should turn
toward England in her sorrow, and it
pains him to think of St. Michael’s steadfast
eyes gazing across the waves of the
bay toward “Namancos and Bayona’s
hold.” “Rather turn hither and let even
your heavenly face relax with human grief,
and ye, unheeding monsters of the deep,
have pity and bear him gently over the
roughening waves.” This he says because
he feels his own impotence. All the love
he bears Lycidas cannot serve him now;
he is lost, and helpless, and alone, and uncared
for. By opposition here, the light
strikes in once more, and now with a
clearer, fuller glow than at either previous
time. At first (line 76) it came in the
form of trust in “all-judging Jove”; then
(line 130) in hope, through belief in impersonal
justice; now it takes the form of
Christian faith. The music mounts higher
and higher into celestial harmonies, losing
entirely its original character, and sounds
like a majestic choral of triumph and
peace.</p>

<p class='c006'>This properly ends the poem with line
185. There is nothing more to be said.
The tendency is all upward, and the collisions
are overcome. One knows that
here, and here for the first time, have we
reached a movement that is self-sustained.
There is no more danger of being carried
off our basis by any wave of despairing
sorrow. The soul has found a solution at
last, and it knows that it is a trustworthy
one.</p>

<p class='c006'>The music is finished; but now, that
nothing may be wanting for perfect effect,
we have the scenery added, and this in
such word-painting as has never been surpassed.
Who could ever weary of line
187—“While the still morn went out with
sandals gray,”—either for its melody or
for its subtle appeal to our senses of hearing
and sight? And the slowly growing
and dying day! Who else has ever so
“touched the tender stops” of imagination?</p>

<p class='c006'>But these woods and pastures are too
full of haunting memories; we seek for
newer ones, where the soul, relieved from
the associations which perpetually call
up the loss of the human and now lifeless
embodiment of spirit, shall be free to think
only of the eternal holding and possessing
which can be sundered by no accident of
time or space.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>ANALYSIS OF HEGEL’S ÆSTHETICS. <br /> [Translated from the French of M. Ch. Bénard, by J. A. Martling.] <br /> Part II. <br /> OF THE GENERAL FORMS OF ART AND ITS HISTORIC DEVELOPMENT.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The first part of Hegel’s Æsthetics contains
the questions relating to the nature
of art in general. The second unfolds its
principal forms in the different historic
epochs. It is a species of philosophy of
the history of art, and contains a great
number of views and descriptions which
cannot appear in this analysis. We shall
take so much the more care, without suffering
ourselves to be turned aside by details,
to indicate plainly the course of the ideas,
and to omit nothing essential.</p>

<p class='c006'>The idea of the Beautiful, or the Ideal,
manifests itself under three essential and
fundamental forms—the <i>symbolic</i>, the <i>classic</i>,
and the <i>romantic</i>. They represent the
three grand epochs of history—the oriental,
the Greek, and the modern.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the East, thought, still vague and indeterminate,
seeks its true expression and
cannot find it. In the presence of the phenomena
of nature and of human life,
spirit, in its infancy, incapable of seizing
the true sense of things, and of comprehending
itself, exhausts itself in vain
efforts to express certain grand, but confused
or obscure conceptions. Instead of
uniting and blending together in a harmonious
whole the content and the form,
the idea and its image, it attains only a
rude and superficial approximation, and
the result is the symbol with its enigmatic
and mysterious meaning.</p>

<p class='c006'>In classic art, on the contrary, this harmonious
blending of the form and the idea
is accomplished. Intelligence, having
taken cognizance of itself and of its freedom,
capable of self-control, of penetrating
the significance of the phenomena
of the universe, and of interpreting its
laws, finds here also the exact correspondence,
the measure and the proportion
which are the characteristics of beauty.
Art creates works which represent the
beautiful under its purest and most perfect
form.</p>

<p class='c006'>But spirit can not rest in this precise
accord of the form and the idea, in which
the infinite and the finite blend. When it
comes to be reflected upon itself, to penetrate
farther into the depths of its inner
nature, to take cognizance of its spirituality
and its freedom, then the idea of the
infinite appears to it stripped of the natural
forms which envelop it. This idea,
present in all its conceptions, can no
longer be perfectly expressed by the forms
of the finite world; it transcends them,
and then this unity, which constitutes the
characteristic of classic art, is broken.
External forms, sensuous images, are no
longer adequate to the expression of the
soul and its free spirituality.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>I. Of Symbolic Art.</h4>
<p class='c005'>After these general considerations, Hegel
treats successively the different forms
of art. Before speaking of symbolic art,
he furnishes an exposition of the <i>symbol</i>
in general.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symbol is an image which represents
an idea. It is distinguished from the
signs of language in this, that between
the image, and the idea which it represents,
there is a natural relation, not an
arbitrary or conventional one. It is thus
that the lion is the symbol of courage; the
circle, of eternity; the triangle, of the
Trinity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symbol, however, does not represent
the idea perfectly, but by a single
side. The lion is not merely courageous;
the fox, cunning. Whence it follows that
the symbol, having many meanings, is
equivocal. This ambiguity ceases only
when the two terms are conceived separately
and then brought into relation; the
symbol then gives place to <i>comparison</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Thus conceived, the symbol, with its
enigmatic and mysterious character, is
peculiarly adapted to an entire epoch of
history, to oriental art and its extraordinary
creations. It characterizes that order of
monuments and emblems by which the
people of the East have sought to express
their ideas, and have been able to do it
only in an equivocal and obscure manner.
These works of art present to us, instead
of beauty and regularity, a strange, imposing,
fantastic aspect.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the development of this form of art
in the East, many degrees are noticeable.
Let us first examine its origin.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sentiment of art, like the religious
sentiment or scientific curiosity, is born
of <i>wonder</i>. The man who is astonished
at nothing lives in a state of imbecility
and stupidity. This state ceases when his
spirit, freeing itself from matter and from
physical wants, is struck by the spectacle
of the phenomena of nature, and seeks
their meaning, when it has the presentiment
of something grand and mysterious
in them, of a concealed power which is revealed
there.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then it experiences also the need of representing
that inner sentiment of a general
and universal power. Particular objects—the
elements, the sea, rivers, mountains—lose
their immediate sense and significance,
and become for spirit images of
this invisible power.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is then that art appears; it arises
from the necessity of representing this
idea by sensuous images, addressed at
once to the senses and the spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>The idea of an absolute power, in religions,
is manifested at first by the worship
of physical objects. The Divinity is
identified with nature itself. But this
rude worship cannot endure. Instead of
seeing the absolute in real objects, man
conceives it as a distinct and universal
being; he seizes, although very imperfectly,
the relation which unites this invisible
principle to the objects of nature;
he fashions an image, a symbol designed
to represent it. Art is then the interpreter
of religious ideas.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is art in its origin; the symbolic
form is born with it. Let us now follow
it in the successive stages of its development,
and indicate its progress in the East
before it attained to the Greek ideal.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which characterizes symbolic art
is that it strives in vain to discover pure
conceptions, and a mode of representation
which befits them. It is the conflict between
the content and the form, both imperfect
and heterogeneous. Hence the
incessant struggle of these two elements
of art, which vainly seek to harmonize.
The stages of its development exhibit the
successive phases or modes of this struggle.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the outset, however, this conflict does
not yet exist, or art is not conscious of it.
The point of departure is a unity yet undivided,
in whose depths the discord between
the two principles ferments. Thus
the creations of art, but little distinct
from the objects of nature, are as yet
scarcely symbols.</p>

<p class='c006'>The end of this epoch is the disappearance
of the symbol. It takes place by the
reflective separation of the two terms.
The idea being clearly conceived, the symbol
on its side being perceived as distinct
from the idea, from their conjunction
arises the <i>reflex</i> symbol, or the comparison,
the allegory, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>These principles having been laid down
<i>a priori</i>, Hegel seeks among the people of
the East the forms of art which correspond
to these various degrees of oriental symbolism.
He finds them chiefly among the
ancient Persians, in India, and in Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Persian Art.</i>—At the first moment of
the history of art, the divine principle,
God, appears identified with nature and
man. In the worship of the Lama, for
example, a real man is adored as God. In
other religions the sun, the mountains, the
rivers, the moon, and animals, are also
the objects of religious worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>The spectacle of this unity of God and
nature is presented to us in the most striking
manner in the life and religion of the
ancient Persians, in the Zend-Avesta.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the religion of Zoroaster, light is God
himself. God is not distinguished from
light viewed as a simple expression, an emblem
or sensuous image of the Divinity.
If light is taken in the sense of the good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and just Being, of the conserving principle
of the Universe, which diffuses everywhere
life and its blessings, it is not merely an
image of the good principle; the sovereign
good itself is light. It is the same with
the opposition of light and darkness, the
latter being considered as the impure element
in every thing—the hideous, the bad,
the principle of death and destruction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hegel seeks to demonstrate this opinion
by an analysis of the principal ideas which
form the content of the Zend-Avesta.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to him, the worship which the
Zend-Avesta describes, is still less symbolic.
All the ceremonies which it imposes
as a religious duty upon the Parsees
are those serious occupations that seek to
extend to all, purity in the physical and
moral sense. One does not find here any
of those symbolic dances which imitate
the course of the stars or any of those religious
acts which have no value except as
images and signs of general conceptions.
There is, then, in it no art properly so-called.
Compared with ruder images or
with the insignificant idols of other peoples,
the worship of light, as pure and universal
substance, presents something beautiful,
elevated, grand, more conformable
to the nature of the supreme good and of
truth. But this conception remains vague;
the imagination creates neither a profound
idea nor a new form. If we see appearing
general types, and the forms which correspond
to them, it is the result of an artificial
combination, not a work of poetry and
art.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus this unity of the invisible principle
and visible objects, constitutes only the
first form of the symbol in art. To attain
to the symbolic form properly so-called, it
is necessary that the distinction and the
separation of the two terms appear clearly
indicated and represented to us. It is this
which takes place in the religion, art, and
poetry of India, which Hegel calls the
symbolic of the <i>imagination</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Indian Art.</i>—The character of the
monuments which betray a more advanced
form and a superior degree of art, is then
the separation of the two terms. Intelligence
forms abstract conceptions, and
seeks forms which express them. Imagination,
properly so-called, is born; art
truly begins. It is not, however, yet the
true symbol.</p>

<p class='c006'>What we encounter at first are the productions
of an imagination which is in a
state of complete ferment and agitation.
In the first attempt of the human spirit to
separate the elements and to reunite them,
its thought is still confused and vague.
The principle of things is not conceived
in its spiritual nature; the ideas concerning
God are empty abstractions; at the
same time the forms which represent Him
bear a character exclusively sensuous and
material. Still plunged in the contemplation
of the sensuous world, having neither
measure nor fixed rule to determine reality,
man exhausts himself in useless efforts
to penetrate the general meaning of the
universe, and can employ, to express the
profoundest thoughts, only rude images
and representations, in which there flashes
out the opposition between the idea and
the form. The imagination passes thus
from one extreme to the other, lifting
itself very high to plunge yet lower, wandering
without support, without guide, and
without aim, in a world of representations
at once imposing, fantastic and grotesque.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hegel characterizes the Indian mythology,
and the art which corresponds to it,
thus: “In the midst of these abrupt and
inconsiderate leaps, of this passage from
one excess to another, if we find anything
of grandeur and an imposing character in
these conceptions, we see afterwards the
universal being, precipitated into the most
ignoble forms of the sensuous world. The
imagination can escape from this contradiction
only by extending indefinitely the
dimensions of the form. It wanders amid
gigantic creations, characterized by the
absence of all measure, and loses itself in
the vague or the arbitrary.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Hegel develops and confirms these
propositions, by following the Indian imagination
in the principal points which
distinguish its art, its poetry, and its
mythology. He makes it apparent that,
in spite of the fertility, the splendor, and
the grandeur of these conceptions, the
Indians have never had a clear idea of
persons and events—a faculty for history;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>that in this continual mingling of the
finite and the infinite, there appears the
complete absence of practical intelligence
and reason. Thought is suffered to run
after the most extravagant and monstrous
chimeras that the imagination can bring
forth. Thus the conception of Brahma is
the abstract idea of being with neither
life nor reality, deprived of real form and
personality. From this idealism pushed
to the extreme, the intelligence precipitates
itself into the most unbridled naturalism.
It deifies objects of nature, the
animals. The divinity appears under the
form of an idiot man, deified because
he belongs to a caste. Each individual,
because he is born in that caste, represents
Brahma in person. The union of
man with God is lowered to the level of a
simply material fact. Thence also the <i>rôle</i>
which the law of the generation of beings
plays in this religion, which gives rise to
the most obscene representations. Hegel,
at the same time, sets forth the contradictions
which swarm in this religion, and
the confusion which reigns in all this
mythology. He establishes a parallel between
the Indian trinity and the Christian
Trinity, and shows their difference. The
three persons of this trinity are not persons;
each of them is an abstraction in
relation to the others; whence it follows
that if this trinity has any analogy with
the Christian Trinity, it is inferior to it,
and we ought to be guarded against recognizing
the Christian tenet in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Examining next the part which corresponds
to Greek polytheism, he demonstrates
likewise its inferiority; he makes
apparent the confusion of those innumerable
theogonies and cosmogonies which
contradict and destroy themselves; and
where, in fine, the idea of natural and not
of spiritual generation is uppermost, where
obscenity is frequently pushed to the last
degree. In the Greek fables, in the theogony
of Hesiod in particular, one frequently
obtains at least a glimpse of a moral
meaning. All is more clear and more explicit,
more strongly coherent, and we do
not remain shut up in the circle of the
divinities of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, in refusing to Indian art
the idea of the truly beautiful, and indeed
of the truly sublime, Hegel recognizes
that it offers to us, principally in its poetry,
“scenes of human life, full of attractiveness
and sweetness, many agreeable
images and tender sentiments, most brilliant
descriptions of nature, charming
features of childlike simplicity and artless
innocence in love; at the same time, occasionally,
much grandeur and nobleness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But as to that which concerns fundamental
conceptions in their totality, the
spiritual cannot disengage itself from the
sensuous. We encounter the most insipid
triviality in connection with the most elevated
situations—a complete absence of
precision and proportion. The sublime is
only the measureless; and as to whatever
lies at the foundation of the myth, the
imagination, dizzy, and incapable of mastering
the flight of the thought, loses itself
in the fantastic, or brings forth only enigmas
which have no significance for reason.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>Egyptian Art.</i>—Thus the creations of
the Indian imagination appear to realize
only imperfectly the idea of the symbolic
form itself. It is in Egypt, among the
monuments of Egyptian art, that we find
the type of the true symbol. It is thus
characterized:</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first stage of art, we started from
the confusion and identity of content and
form, of spirit and nature. Next form and
content are separated and opposed. Imagination
has sought vainly to combine them,
and is successful only in making clear
their disproportion. In order that thought
may be free, it is necessary that it get rid
of its material form—that it destroy it. The
<i>moment</i> of destruction, of negation, or annihilation,
is then necessary in order that
spirit arrive at consciousness of itself and
its spirituality. This idea of death as a
<i>moment</i> of the divine nature is already
contained in the Indian religion; but it is
only a changing, a transformation, and an
abstraction. The gods are annihilated
and pass the one into the other, and all
in their turn into a single being—Brahma,
the universal being. In the Persian religion
the two principles, negative and
positive—Ormuzd and Ahriman—exist separately
and remain separated. Now this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>principle of negation, of death and resurrection,
as moments and attributes of
the divine nature, constitutes the foundation
of a new religion; this thought is
expressed in it by the forms of its worship,
and appears in all its conceptions
and monuments. It is the fundamental
characteristic of the art and religion of
Egypt. Thus we see the glorification of
death and of suffering, as the annihilation
of sensuous nature, appear in the consciousness
of peoples in the worships of
Asia Minor, of Phrygia and Phoenicia.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if death is a necessary “moment” in
the life of the absolute, it does not rest in
that annihilation; this is, in order to pass
to a superior existence, to arrive, after the
destruction of visible existence, by resurrection,
at divine immortality. Death is
only the birth of a more elevated principle
and the triumph of spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Henceforth, physical form, in art, loses
its independent value and its separate existence;
still further, the conflict of form
and idea ought to cease. Form is subordinated
to idea. That fermentation of the
imagination which produces the fantastic,
quiets itself and is calm. The previous
conceptions are replaced by a mode of
representation, enigmatic, it is true, but
superior, and which offers to us the true
character of the symbol.</p>

<p class='c006'>The idea begins to assert itself. On its
side, the symbol takes a form more precise;
the spiritual principle is revealed
more clearly, and frees itself from physical
nature, although it cannot yet appear
in all its clearness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following mode of representation
corresponds to this idea of symbolic art:
in the first place, the forms of nature and
human actions express something other
than themselves; they reveal the divine
principle by qualities which are in real
analogy with it. The phenomena and the
laws of nature, which, in the different kingdoms,
represent life, birth, growth, death
and the resurrection of beings, are preferred.
Such are the germination and the
growth of plants, the phases of the course of
the sun, the succession of the seasons, the
phenomena of the increase and decrease of
the Nile, etc. Here, because of the real
resemblance and of natural analogies, the
fantastic is abandoned. One observes a
more intelligent choice of symbolic forms.
There is an imagination which already
knows how to regulate itself and to control
itself—which shows more of calmness
and reason.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here then appears a higher conciliation
of idea and form, and at the same time an
extraordinary tendency towards art, an
irresistible inclination which is satisfied
in a manner wholly symbolic, but superior
to the previous modes. It is the proper
tendency towards art, and principally towards
the figurative arts. Hence the necessity
of finding and fashioning a form, an
emblem which may express the idea and
may be subordinated to it; of creating a
work which may reveal to spirit a general
conception; of presenting a spectacle which
may show that these forms have been
chosen for the purpose of expressing profound
ideas.</p>

<p class='c006'>This emblematic or symbolic combination
can be effected in various ways. The
most abstract expression is number. The
symbolism of numbers plays a very important
part in Egyptian art. The sacred
numbers recur unceasingly in flights of
steps, columns, etc. There are, moreover,
symbolic figures traced in space, the windings
of the labyrinth, the sacred dances
which represent the movements of the heavenly
bodies. In a higher grade is placed the
human form, already moulded to a higher
perfection than in India. A general symbol
sums up the principal idea; it is the
phœnix, which consumes itself and rises
from its ashes.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the myths which serve for the transition,
as those of Asia Minor—in the myth
of Adonis mourned by Venus; in that of
Castor and Pollux, and in the fable of
Proserpine, this idea of death and resurrection
is very apparent.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is Egypt, above all, which has symbolized
this idea. Egypt is the land of the
symbol. However, the problems are not
resolved. The enigmas of Egyptian art
were enigmas to the Egyptians themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>However this may be in the East, the
Egyptians, among eastern nations, are the
truly artistic people. They show an indefatigable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>activity in satisfying that longing
for symbolic representation which torments
them. But their monuments remain
mysterious and mute. The spirit
has not yet found the form which is appropriate
to it; it does not yet know how
to speak the clear and intelligible language
of spirit. “They were, above all,
an architectural people; they excavated
the soil, scooped out lakes, and, with their
instinct of art, elevated gigantic structures
into the light of day, and executed
under the soil works equally immense. It
was the occupation, the life of this people,
which covered the land with monuments,
nowhere else in so great quantity and under
forms so varied.”</p>

<p class='c006'>If we wish to characterize in a more precise
manner the monuments of Egyptian
art, and to penetrate the sense of them,
we discover the following aspects:</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, the principal idea, the
idea of death, is conceived as a “moment”
of the life of spirit, not as a principle of
evil; this is the opposite of the Persian dualism.
Nor is there an absorption of beings
into the universal Being, as in the Indian
religion. The invisible preserves its existence
and its personality; it preserves even
its physical form. Hence the embalmings,
the worship of the dead. Moreover, the
imagination is lifted higher than this visible
duration. Among the Egyptians, for
the first time, appears the clear distinction
of soul and body, and the dogma of
immortality. This idea, nevertheless, is
still imperfect, for they accord an equal
importance to the duration of the body and
that of the soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the conception which serves as
a foundation for Egyptian art, and which
betrays itself under a multitude of symbolic
forms. It is in this idea that we
must seek the meaning of the works of
Egyptian architecture. Two worlds—the
world of the living and that of the dead;
two architectures—the one on the surface
of the ground, the other subterranean.
The labyrinths, the tombs, and, above all,
the pyramids, represent this idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pyramid, image of symbolic art, is
a species of envelope, cut in crystalline
form, which conceals a mystic object, an
invisible being. Hence, also, the exterior,
superstitious side of worship, an excess
difficult to escape, the adoration of the
divine principle in animals, a gross worship
which is no longer even symbolic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hieroglyphic writing, another form of
Egyptian art, is itself in great part symbolic,
since it makes ideas known by
images borrowed from nature, and which
have some analogy with those ideas.</p>

<p class='c006'>But a defect betrays itself, especially in
the representations of the human form.
In fact, though a mysterious and spiritual
force is there revealed, it is not true personality.
The internal principle fails;
action and impulse come from without.
Such are the statues of Memnon, which
are animate, have a voice, and give forth
a sound, only when struck by the rays of
the sun. It is not the human voice which
comes from within—an echo of the soul.
This free principle which animates the
human form, remains here concealed,
wrapped up, mute, without proper spontaneity,
and is only animated under the influence
of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>A superior form is that of the Myth of
Osiris, the Egyptian god, <i>par excellence</i>—that
god who is engendered, born, dies and
is resuscitated. In this myth, which offers
various significations, physical, historical,
moral, and religious or metaphysical, is
shown the superiority of these conceptions
over those of Indian art.</p>

<p class='c006'>In general, in Egyptian art, there is revealed
a profounder, more spiritual, and
more moral character. The human form
is no longer a simple, abstract personification.
Religion and art attempt to spiritualize
themselves; they do not attain their
object, but they catch sight of it and
aspire to it. From this imperfection
arises the absence of freedom in the human
form. The human figure still remains
without expression, colossal, serious,
rigid. Thus is explained those attitudes
of the Egyptian statues, the arms
stiff, pressed against the body, without
grace, without movement, and without
life, but absorbed in profound thought,
and full of seriousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence also the complication of the elements
and symbols, which are intermingled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and reflected the one in the other; a thing
which indicates the freedom of spirit, but
also an absence of clearness and definiteness.
Hence the obscure, enigmatic character
of those symbols, which always cause
scholars to despair—enigmas to the Egyptians
themselves. These emblems involve
a multitude of profound meanings. They
remain there as a testimony of fruitless
efforts of spirit to comprehend itself, a
symbolism full of mysteries, a vast enigma
represented by a symbol which sums up all
these enigmas—the sphinx. This enigma
Egypt will propose to Greece, who herself
will make of it the problems of religion
and philosophy. The sense of this enigma,
never solved, and yet always solving, is
“Man, <i>know thyself</i>.”—Such is the maxim
which Greece inscribed on the front of her
temples, the problem which she presented
to her sages as the very end of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. <i>Hebrew Poetry.</i>—In this review of
the different forms of art and of worship
among the different nations of the east,
mention should be made of a religion
which is characterized precisely by the
rejection of all symbol, and in this respect
is little favorable to art, but whose poetry
bears the impress of grandeur and sublimity.
And thus Hegel designates Hebrew
Poetry by the title of <i>Art of the Sublime</i>.
At the same time he casts a glance
upon Mahometan pantheism, which also
proscribes images, and banishes from its
temples every figurative representation of
the Divinity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sublime, as Kant has well described
it, is the attempt to express the infinite
in the finite, without finding any sensuous
form which is capable of representing
it. It is the infinite, manifested
under a form which, making clear this opposition,
reveals the immeasurable grandeur
of the infinite as surpassing all representation
in finite forms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, here, two points of view are to be
distinguished. Either the infinite is the
Absolute Being conceived by thought, as
the immanent substance of things, or it is
the Infinite Being as distinct from the beings
of the real world, but elevating itself
above them by the entire distance which
separates it from the finite, so that, compared
with it, they are only pure nothing.
God is thus purified from all contact, from
all participation with sensuous existence,
which disappears and is annihilated in his
presence.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the first point of view corresponds
oriental pantheism. God is there conceived
as the absolute Being, immanent in objects
the most diverse, in the sun, the sea,
the rivers, the trees, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>A conception like this cannot be expressed
by the figurative arts, but only by
poetry. Where pantheism is pure, it admits
no sensuous representation and proscribes
images. We find this pantheism
in India. All the superior gods of the Indian
mythology are absorbed in the Absolute
unity, or in Brahm. Oriental pantheism
is developed in a more formal and
brilliant manner in Mahometanism, and in
particular among the Persian Mahometans.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the truly sublime is that which is
represented by Hebrew poetry. Here, for
the first time, God appears truly as Spirit,
as the invisible Being in opposition to nature.
On the other side, the entire universe,
in spite of the richness and magnificence
of its phenomena, compared with
the Being supremely great, is nothing by
itself. Simple creation of God, subject to
his power, it only exists to manifest and
glorify him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the idea which forms the ground
of that poetry, the characteristic of which
is sublimity. In the beautiful the idea
pierces through the external reality of
which it is the soul, and forms with it a
harmonious unity. In the sublime, the visible
reality, where the Infinite is manifested,
is abased in its presence. This superiority,
this exaltation of the Infinite
over the finite, the infinite distance which
separates them, is what the art of the sublime
should express. It is religious art—preëminently,
sacred art; its unique design
is to celebrate the glory of God. This
rôle, poetry alone can fill.</p>

<p class='c006'>The prevailing idea of Hebrew poetry is
God as master of the world, God in his
independent existence and pure essence,
inaccessible to sense and to all sensuous
representation which does not correspond
to his grandeur. God is the Creator of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>universe. All gross ideas concerning the
generation of beings give place to that of
a spiritual creation: “Let there be light,
and there was light.” That sentence indicates
a creation by word—expression of
thought and of will.</p>

<p class='c006'>Creation then takes a new aspect, nature
and man are no longer deified. To
the infinite is clearly opposed the finite,
which is no longer confounded with the
divine principle as in the symbolic conceptions
of other peoples. Situations and
events are delineated more clearly. The
characters assume a more fixed and precise
meaning. They are human figures which
offer no more anything fantastic and
strange; they are perfectly intelligible
and accessible to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other side, in spite of his powerlessness
and his nothingness, man obtains
here freer and more independent place
than in other religions. The immutable
character of the divine will gives birth to
the idea of law to which man must be subject.
His conduct becomes enlightened,
fixed, regular. The perfect distinction of
human and divine, of finite and infinite,
brings in that of good and evil, and permits
an enlightened choice. Merit and
demerit is the consequence of it. To live
according to justice in the fulfilment of
law is the end of human existence, and it
places man in direct communication with
God. Here is the principle and explanation
of his whole life, of his happiness and
his misery. The events of life are considered
as blessings, as recompenses, or as
trials and chastisements.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here also appears the miracle. Elsewhere,
all was prodigious, and, by consequence,
nothing was miraculous. The
miracle supposes a regular succession, a
constant order, and an interruption of that
order. But the whole entire creation is a
perpetual miracle, designed for the glorification
and praise of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such are the ideas which are expressed
with so much splendor, elevation and poetry,
in the Psalms—classic examples of
the truly sublime—in the Prophets, and the
sacred books in general. This recognition
of the nothingness of things, of the greatness
and omnipotence of God, of the unworthiness
of man in his presence, the
complaints, the lamentations, the outcry
of the soul towards God, constitute their
pathos and their sublimity.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>Of the Reflex Symbol.</h4>
<p class='c005'><i>Fable, Apologue, Allegory, etc.</i>—We
have run over the different forms which
symbolism presents among the different
people of the East, and we have seen it disappear
in the sublime, which places the
infinite so far above the finite that it can
no longer be represented by sensuous
forms, but only celebrated in its grandeur
and its power.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before passing to another epoch of art,
Hegel points out, as a transition from the
oriental symbol to the Greek ideal, a mixed
form whose basis is <i>comparison</i>. This
form, which also belongs principally to the
East, is manifested in different kinds of
poetry, such as <i>the fable</i>, <i>the apologue</i>, <i>the
proverb</i>, <i>allegory</i>, and <i>comparison</i>, properly
so-called.</p>

<p class='c006'>The author develops in the following
manner the nature of this form and the
place which he assigns to it in the development
of art:</p>

<p class='c006'>In the symbol, properly so-called, the
idea and the form, although distinct and
even opposed, as in the sublime, are reunited
by an essential and necessary tie;
the two elements are not strangers to one
another, and the spirit seizes the relation
immediately. Now the separation of the
two terms, which has already its beginning
in the symbol, ought also to be clearly
effected, and find its place in the development
of art. And as spirit works no
longer spontaneously, but with reflection,
it is also in a reflective manner that it
brings the two terms together. This form
of art, whose basis is comparison, may
be called the <i>reflexive symbolic</i> in opposition
to the <i>irreflexive</i> symbolic, whose
principal forms we have studied.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, in this form of art, the connection
of the two elements is no more, as heretofore,
a connection founded upon the nature
of the idea; it is more or less the result
of an artificial combination which depends
upon the will of the poet, or his
vigor of imagination, and on his genius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>for invention. Sometimes it starts from a
sensuous phenomenon to which he lends a
spiritual meaning, an idea, by making use
of some analogy. Sometimes it is an idea
which he seeks to clothe with a sensuous
form, or with an image, by a certain resemblance.</p>

<p class='c006'>This mode of conception is clear but superficial.
In the East it plays a distinct
part, or appears to prevail as one of the
characteristic traits of oriental thought.
Later, in the grand composition of classic
or romantic poetry, it is subordinated; it
furnishes ornaments and accessories, allegories,
images and metaphors; it constitutes
secondary varieties.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hegel then divides this form of art, and
classes the varieties to which it gives rise.
He distinguishes, for this purpose, two
points of view: first, the case when the
sensuous fact is presented first to spirit,
and spirit afterwards gives it a signification,
as in the <i>fable</i>, the <i>parable</i>, the <i>apologue</i>,
the <i>proverb</i>, the <i>metamorphoses</i>;
second, the case where, on the other hand,
it is the idea which appears first to the
spirit, and the poet afterwards seeks to
adapt to it an image, a sensuous form, by
way of comparison. Such are the <i>enigma</i>,
the <i>allegory</i>, the <i>metaphor</i>, the <i>image</i>,
and the <i>comparison</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall not follow the author in the
developments which he thinks necessary
to give to the analysis of each of these
inferior forms of poetry or art.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c012'>II. Of Classic Art.</h4>
<p class='c005'>The aim of art is to represent the ideal,
that is to say, the perfect accord of the two
elements of the beautiful, the idea and the
sensuous form. Now this object symbolic
art endeavors vainly to attain. Sometimes
it is nature with its blind force which
forms the ground of its representations;
sometimes it is the spiritual Being, which
it conceives in a vague manner, and which
it personifies in inferior divinities. Between
the idea and the form there is revealed
a simple affinity, an external correspondence.
The attempt to reconcile
them makes clearer the opposition; or art,
in wishing to express spirit, only creates
obscure enigmas. Everywhere there is betrayed
the absence of true personality and
of freedom. For these are able to unfold,
only with the clear consciousness of itself
that spirit achieves. We have met, it is
true, this idea of the nature of spirit as
opposed to the sensuous world, clearly expressed
in the religion and poetry of the
Hebrew people. But what is born of this
opposition is not the Beautiful, it is the
Sublime. A living sentiment of personality
is further manifest in the East, in the
Arabic race. In the scorching deserts, in
the midst of free space, it has ever been
distinguished by this trait of independence
and individuality, which betrays itself by
hatred of the stranger, thirst for vengeance,
a deliberate cruelty, also by
love, by greatness of soul and devotion,
and, above all, by passion for adventure.
This race is also distinguished by a mind
free and clear, ingenious and full of subtlety,
lively, brilliant—of which it has given
so many proofs in the arts and sciences.
But we have here only a superficial side,
devoid of profundity and universality; it
is not true personality supported on a solid
basis, on a knowledge of the spirit and of
the moral nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>All these elements, separate or united,
cannot, then, present the Ideal. They are
antecedents, conditions, and materials,
and, together, offer nothing which corresponds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>to the idea of real beauty. This
ideal beauty we shall find realized, for the
first time, among the Greek race and in
Classic art, which we now propose to characterize.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order that the two elements of beauty
may be perfectly harmonized, it is necessary
that the first, the idea, be the spirit
itself, possessed of the consciousness of its
nature and of its free personality. If one
is then asked, what is the form which corresponds
to this idea, which expresses the
personal, individual spirit, the only answer
is, <i>the human form</i>, for it alone is
capable of manifesting spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Classic art, which represents free spirituality
under an individual form, is then
necessarily anthropomorphic. Anthropomorphism
is its very essence, and we shall
do it wrong to make of this a reproach.
Christian art and the Christian religion are
themselves anthropomorphic, and this they
are in a still higher degree since God made
himself really man, since Christ is not a
mere divine personification conceived by
the imagination, since he is both truly God
and truly man. He passed through all the
phases of earthly existence; he was born,
he suffered, and he died. In classic art
sensuous nature does not die, but it has
no resurrection. Thus this religion does
not fully satisfy the human soul. The
Greek ideal has for basis an unchangeable
harmony between the spirit and the sensuous
form, the unalterable serenity of the
immortal gods; but this calm is somewhat
frigid and inanimate. Classic art did not
take in the true essence of the divine nature,
nor penetrate the depths of the soul.
It could not unveil the innermost powers in
their opposition, or re-establish their harmony.
All this phase of existence, wickedness,
misfortune, moral suffering, the revolt
of the will, gnawings and rendings of
the soul, were unknown to it. It did not
pass beyond the proper domain of sensuous
beauty; but it represented it perfectly.</p>

<p class='c006'>This ideal of classic beauty was realized
by the Greeks. The most favorable conditions
for unfolding it were found combined
among them. The geographical position,
the genius of that people, its moral character,
its political life, all could not but
aid the accomplishment of that idea of
classic beauty, whose characteristics are
proportion, measure, and harmony. Placed
between Asia and Europe, Greece realized
the accord of personal liberty and public
manners, of the State and the individual,
of spirit general and particular. Its genius,
a mixture of spontaneity and reflection, presented
an equal fusion of contraries. The
feeling of this auspicious harmony pierces
through all the productions of the Greek
mind. It was the moment of youth in the
life of humanity—a fleeting age, a moment
unique and irrevocable, like that of beauty
in the individual.</p>

<p class='c006'>Art attains then the culminating point of
sensuous beauty under the form of plastic
individuality. The worship of the Beautiful
is the entire life of the Greek race.
Thus religion and art are identified. All
forms of Greek civilization are subordinate
to art.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is important here to determine the
new position of the artist in the production
of works of art.</p>

<p class='c006'>Art appears here not as a production of
nature, but as a creation of the individual
spirit. It is the work of a free spirit which
is conscious of itself, which is self-possessed,
which has nothing vague or obscure in
its thought, and finds itself hindered by no
technical difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'>This new position of the Greek artist
manifests itself in content, form, and technical
skill.</p>

<p class='c006'>With regard to the content, or the ideas
which it ought to represent, in opposition
to symbolic art, where the spirit gropes
and seeks without power to arrive at a
clear notion, the artist finds the idea already
made in the dogma, the popular
faith, and a complete, precise idea, of
which he renders to himself an account.
Nevertheless, he does not enslave himself
with it; he accepts it, but reproduces it
freely. The Greek artists received their
subjects from the popular religion; which
was an idea originally transmitted from the
East, but already transformed in the consciousness
of the people. They, in their
turn, transformed it into the sense of the
beautiful; they both reproduced and created
it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>But it is above all upon the form that
this free activity concentrates and exercises
itself. While symbolic art wearies itself
in seeking a thousand extraordinary
forms to represent its ideas, having neither
measure nor fixed rule, the Greek artist
confines himself to his subject, the limits
of which he respects. Then between the
content and the form he establishes a perfect
harmony, for, in elaborating the form,
he also perfects the content. He frees
them both from useless accessories, in order
to adapt the one to the other. Henceforth
he is not checked by an immovable and
traditional type; he perfects the whole;
for content and form are inseparable; he
develops both in the serenity of inspiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the technical element, ability combined
with inspiration belongs to the classic
artist in the highest degree. Nothing
restrains or embarrasses him. Here are
no hindrances as in a stationary religion,
where the forms are consecrated by usage;
in Egypt, for example. And this ability
is always increasing. Progress in the processes
of art is necessary to the realization
of pure beauty, and the perfect execution
of works of genius.</p>

<p class='c006'>After these general considerations upon
classic art, Hegel studies it more in detail.
He considers it 1st, in its development; 2d,
in itself, as realization of the ideal; 3d,
in the causes which have produced its
downfall.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In what concerns the development
of Greek art, the author dwells long upon
the history and progress of mythology.
This is because religion and art are confused.
The central point of Greek art is
Olympus and its beautiful divinities.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following are what are, according
to Hegel, the principal stages of the development
of art, and of the Greek mythology.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first stage of progress consists in a
reaction against the Symbolic form, which
it is interested in destroying. The Greek
Gods came from the East; the Greeks borrowed
their divinities from foreign religions.
On the other hand, we can say they
invented them: for invention does not exclude
borrowing. They transformed the
ideas contained in the anterior traditions.
Now upon what had this transformation
any bearing? In it is the history of polytheism
and antique art, which follows a
parallel course, and is inseparable from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Grecian divinities are, first of all,
moral personages invested with the human
form. The first development consists, then,
in rejecting those gross symbols, which, in
the oriental naturalism, form the object of
worship, and which disfigure the representations
of art. This progress is marked
by the degradation of the animal kingdom.
It is clearly indicated in a great number
of ceremonies and fables of polytheism,
by sacrifices of animals, sacred hunts, and
many of the exploits attributed to heroes,
in particular the labors of Hercules. Some
of the fables of Æsop have the same meaning.
The metamorphoses of Ovid are also
disfigured myths, or fables become burlesque,
of which the content, easy to be
recognized, contains the same idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the opposite of the manner in
which the Egyptians considered animals.
Nature, here, in place of being venerated
and adored, is lowered and degraded. To
wear an animal form is no longer deification;
it is the punishment of a monstrous
crime. The gods themselves are shamed
by such a form, and they assume it only to
satisfy the passions of the sensual nature.
Such is the signification of many of the
fables of Jupiter, as those of Danaë, of
Europa, of Leda, of Ganymede. The representation
of the generative principle in
nature, which constitutes the content of
the ancient mythologies, is here changed
into a series of histories where the father
of gods and men plays a rôle but little
edifying, and frequently ridiculous. Finally,
all that part of religion which relates
to sensual desires is crowded into the
background, and represented by subordinate
divinities: Circe, who changes men
into swine; Pan, Silenus, the Satyrs and
the Fauns. The human form predominates,
the animal being barely indicated by ears,
by little horns, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another advance is to be noted in the
<i>oracles</i>. The phenomena of nature, in
place of being an object of admiration and
worship, are only signs by which the gods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>make known their will to mortals. These
prophetic signs become more and more
simple, till at last it is, above all, the voice
of man which is the organ of the oracle.
The oracle is ambiguous, so that the man
who receives it is obliged to interpret it,
to blend his reason with it. In dramatic
art, for example, man does not act solely
by himself; he consults the gods, he obeys
their will; but his will is confounded with
theirs; a place is reserved for his liberty.</p>

<p class='c006'>The distinction between the <i>old</i> and the
<i>new</i> divinities marks still more this progress
of moral liberty. Among the former,
who personify the powers of nature, a
gradation is already established. In the
first place, the untamed and lower powers,
Chaos, Tartarus, Erebus; then Uranus,
Gea, the Giants and the Titans; in a higher
rank, Prometheus, at first the friend of
the new gods, the benefactor of men, then
punished by Jupiter for that apparent beneficence;
an inconsequence which is explained
through this, that if Prometheus
taught industry to men, he created an occasion
of discords and dissensions, by not
giving them instruction more elevated,—morality,
the science of government, the
guarantees of property. Such is the profound
sense of that myth, and Plato thus
explains it in his dialogues.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another class of divinities equally ancient,
but already ethical, although they
recall the fatality of the physical laws, are
the Eumenides, Dice, and the Furies. We
see appearing here the ideas of right and
justice, but of exclusive, absolute, strict,
unconscious right, under the form of an
implacable vengeance, or, like the ancient
Nemesis, of a power which abases all that
is high, and re-establishes equality by levelling;
a thing which is the opposite of true
justice.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally, this development of the classic
ideal reveals itself more clearly in the <i>theogony</i>
and <i>genealogy</i> of the gods, in their
origin and their succession, by the abasement
of the divinities of the previous
races; in the hostility which flashes out
between them, in the resolution which has
carried away the sovereignty from the old
to place it in the hands of the new divinities.
Meanwhile the distinction develops
itself to the point of engendering strife,
and the conflict becomes the principal
event of mythology.</p>

<p class='c006'>This conflict is that of nature and spirit,
and it is the law of the world. Under
the historic form, it is the perfecting of
human nature, the successive conquest of
rights and property, the amelioration of
laws and of the political constitution. In
the religious representations, it is the triumph
of the moral divinities over the powers
of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>This combat is announced as the grandest
catastrophe in the history of the world:
moreover, this is not the subject of a particular
myth; it is the principal, decisive
fact, which constitutes the centre of this
mythology.</p>

<p class='c006'>The conclusion of all this in respect to
the history of art and to the development
of the ideal, is that art ought to act like
mythology, and reject as unworthy all that
is purely physical or animal, that which is
confused, fantastic, or obscure, all gross
mingling of the material and the spiritual.
All these creations of an ill-regulated imagination
find here no more place; they
must flee before the light of the Soul. Art
purifies itself of all caprice, fancy, or symbolic
accessory, of every vague and confused
idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>In like manner, the new gods form an
organized and established world. This
unity affirms and perfects itself more in
the later developments of plastic art and
poetry.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, the old elements, driven
back by the accession of moral forces, preserve
a place at their side, or are combined
with them. Such is, for example, the significance
and the aim of the mysteries.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the new divinities, who are ethical
persons, there remains also an echo, a reflex
of the powers of nature. They present,
consequently, a combination of the
physical and the ethical element, but the
first is subordinate to the second. Thus,
Neptune is the sea, but he is besides invoked
as the god of navigation and the
founder of cities; Apollo is the Sun, the
god of light, but he is also the god of spiritual
light, of science and of the oracles.
In Jupiter, Diana, Hercules, and Venus, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>is easy to discover the physical side combined
with the moral sense.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, in the new divinities, the elements
of nature, after having been debased
and degraded, reappear and are
preserved. This is also true of the
forms of the animal kingdom; but the
symbolic sense is more and more lost.
They figure no longer as accessories combined
with the human form; but are reduced
to mere emblems or attributes—indicating
signs, as the eagle by the side of
Jupiter, the peacock before Juno, the dove
near Venus, where the principal myth is
no more than an accidental fact, of little
importance in the life of the god, and
which, abandoned to the imagination of the
poets, becomes the text of licentious histories.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. After having considered the development
of the ideal in Greek art, a development
parallel to that of religion and mythology,
we have to consider it in its
principal characteristics, such as it has
emanated from the creative activity or
from the imagination of the poet and the
artist.</p>

<p class='c006'>This mythology has its origin in the previous
religions, but its gods are the creation
of Homer and Hesiod. Tradition furnished
the materials; but the idea which
each god ought to represent, and, besides,
the form which expresses it in its purity
and simplicity—this is what was not given.
This ideal type the poets drew from their
genius, discovering also the true form
which befitted it. Thereby they were creators
of that mythology which we admire
in Greek art, and which is confounded
with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Greek gods have no less their origin
in the spirit and the credences of the
Greek people, and in the national belief;
the poets were the interpreters of the general
thought, of what there was most elevated
in the imagination of the people.
Henceforth, the artist, as we have seen
above, takes a position wholly different
from that which he held in the East. His
inspiration is personal. His work is that of
a free imagination, creating according to
its own conceptions. The inspiration does
not come from without; what they reveal
is the ideas of the human spirit, what
there is deepest in the heart of man. Also,
the artists are truly poets; they fashion,
according to their liking, the content and
the form, in order to draw from them free
and original figures. Tradition is shorn,
in their hands, of all that is gross,
symbolic, repulsive, and deformed; they
eliminate the idea which they wish to
illustrate, and individualize it under the
human form. Such is the manner, free,
though not arbitrary, in which the Greek
artists proceed in the creation of their
works.</p>

<p class='c006'>They are poets, but also prophets and
diviners. They represent human actions
in divine actions, and, reciprocally, without
having the clear and decided distinctions.
They maintain the union, the accord,
of the human and the divine. Such is
the significance of the greater part of the
apparitions of the gods in Homer, when
the gods, for example, consult the heroes,
or interfere in the combats.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, if we wish to understand the
<i>nature of this ideal</i>, to determine, in a
more precise manner, the character of the
divinities of Greek art, the following remarks
are suggested, considering them, at
the same time, on the <i>general</i>, the <i>particular</i>,
and the <i>individual</i> sides.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first attribute which distinguishes
them is something general, substantial.
The immortal gods are strangers to the
miseries and to the agitations of human
existence. They enjoy an unalterable
calmness and serenity, from which they
derive their repose and their majesty. They
are not, however, vague abstractions, universal
and purely ideal existences. To this
character of generality is joined individuality.
Each divinity has his traits and
proper physiognomy, his particular rôle,
his sphere of activity, determined and limited.
A just measure, moreover, is here
observed: the two elements, the general
and the individual, are in perfect accord.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the same time, this moral character
is manifested under an external and corporeal
form itself, its most perfect expression,
in which appears the harmonious fusion
of the external form with the internal
principle animating it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>This physical form, as well as the spiritual
principle which is manifested in it, is
freed from all the accidents of material
life, and from the miseries of finite existence.
It is the human body with its beautiful
proportions and their harmony; all
announces beauty, liberty, grace. It is
thus that this form, in its purity, corresponds
to the spiritual and divine principle
which is incarnate in it. Hence the
nobleness, the grandeur, and the elevation
of those figures, which have nothing in
common with the wants of material life,
and seem elevated above their bodily existence.
They are immortal divinities with
human features. The body, in spite of its
beauty, appears as a superfluous appendage;
and, nevertheless, it is an animated
and living form which presents the indestructible
harmony of the two principles,
the soul and the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>But a contradiction presents itself between
the spirit and the material form.
This harmonious whole conceals a principle
of destruction which will make itself
felt more and more. We may perceive in
these figures an air of sadness in the midst
of greatness. Though absorbed in themselves,
calm and serene, they lack freedom
from care and inward satisfaction; something
cold and impassive is found in their
features, especially if we compare them
with the vivacity of modern sentiment.
This divine peace, this indifference to all
that is mortal and transient, forms a contrast
with the moral greatness and the corporeal
form. These placid divinities complain
both of their felicity and of their
physical existence. We read upon their
features the destiny which weighs them
down.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, what is the particular art most appropriate
to represent this ideal? Evidently
it is <i>sculpture</i>. It alone is capable
of showing us those ideal figures in their
eternal repose, of expressing the perfect
harmony of the spiritual principle and the
sensuous form. To it has been confided
the mission of realizing this ideal in its
purity, its greatness, and its perfection.</p>

<p class='c006'>Poetry, above all, dramatic poetry, which
makes the gods act, and draws them into
strife and combat contrary to their greatness
and their dignity, is much less capable
of answering this purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we consider these divinities in their
particular, and no longer in their general
character, we see that they form a plurality,
a whole, a totality, which is <i>polytheism</i>.
Each particular god, while having his proper
and original character, is himself a complete
whole; he also possesses the distinctive
qualities of the other divinities.
Hence the richness of these characters. It
is for this reason that the Greek polytheism
does not present a systematic whole.
Olympus is composed of a multitude of
distinct gods, who do not form an established
hierarchy. Rank is not rigorously
fixed, whence the liberty, the serenity, the
independence of the personages. Without
this apparent contradiction, the divinities
would be embarrassed by one another,
shackled in their development and power.
In place of being true persons, they would
be only allegorical beings, or personified
abstractions.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to their sensuous representation,
sculpture is, moreover, the art best adapted
to express this particular characteristic
of the nature of the gods. By combining
with immovable grandeur the individuality
of features peculiar to each of them, it fixes
in their statues the most perfect expression
of their character, and determines its
definite form. Sculpture, here again, is
more ideal than poetry. It offers a more
determined and fixed form, while poetry
mingles with it a crowd of actions, of histories
and accidental particulars. Sculpture
creates absolute and eternal models;
it has fixed the type of true, classic beauty,
which is the basis of all other productions
of Greek genius, and is here the central
point of art.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in order to represent the gods in
their true <i>individuality</i>, it does not suffice
to distinguish them by certain particular
attributes. Moreover, classic art does not
confine itself to representing these personages
as immovable and self-absorbed; it
shows them also in movement and in action.
The character of the gods then particularizes
itself, and exhibits the special
features of which the physiognomy of each
god is composed. This is the accidental,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>positive, historic side, which figures in
mythology and also in art, as an accessory
but necessary element.</p>

<p class='c006'>These materials are furnished by history
or fable. They are the antecedents, the
local particulars, which give to the gods
their living individuality and originality.
Some are borrowed from the symbolic religions,
which preserve a vestige thereof in
the new creation; the symbolic element is
absorbed in the new myth. Others have a
national origin, which, again, is connected
with heroic times and foreign traditions.
Others, finally, spring from local circumstances,
relating to the propagation of the
myths, to their formation, to the usages
and ceremonies of worship, etc. All these
materials fashioned by art, give to the
Greek gods the appearance, the interest,
and the charm, of living humanity. But
this traditional side, which in its origin
had a symbolic sense, loses it little by little;
it is designed only to complete the individuality
of the gods, to give to them a
more human and more sensuous form, to
add, through details frequently unworthy
of divine majesty, the side of the arbitrary
and accidental. Sculpture, which represents
the pure ideal, ought, without wholly
excluding it in fact, to allow it to appear
as little as possible; it represents it as
accessory in the head-dress, the arms, the
ornaments, the external attributes. Another
source for the more precise determination
of the character of the gods is
their intervention in the actions and circumstances
of human life. Here the imagination
of the poet expands itself as an
inexhaustible source in a crowd of particular
histories, of traits of character and
actions, attributed to the gods. The problem
of art consists in combining, in a
natural and living manner, the actions of
divine personages and human actions, in
such a manner that the gods appear as the
general cause of what man himself accomplishes.
The gods, thus, are the internal
principles which reside in the depths of the
human soul; its own passions, in so far as
they are elevated, and its personal thought;
or it is the necessity of the situation, the
force of circumstances, from whose fatal
action man suffers. It is this which pierces
through all the situations where Homer
causes the gods to intervene, and through
the manner in which they influence events.</p>

<p class='c006'>But through this side, the gods of classic
art abandon, more and more, the silent
serenity of the ideal, to descend into the
multiplicity of individual situations, of
actions, and into the conflict of human
passions. Classic art thus finds itself
drawn to the last degree of individualization;
it falls into the agreeable and the
graceful. The divine is absorbed in the
finite which is addressed exclusively to the
sensibility and no longer satisfies thought.
Imagination and art, seizing this side and
exaggerating it more and more, corrupt
religion itself. The severe ideal gives
place to merely sensuous beauty and harmony;
it removes itself more and more
from the eternal ideas which form the
ground of religion and art, and these are
dragged down to ruin.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. In fact, independently of the external
causes which have occasioned the <i>decadence</i>
of Greek art and precipitated its
downfall, many internal causes, in the
very nature of the Greek ideal, rendered
that downfall inevitable. In the first place,
the Greek gods, as we have seen, bear in
themselves the germ of their destruction,
and the defect which they conceal is unveiled
by the representations of classic art
itself. The plurality of the gods and their
diversity makes them already accidental
existences; this multiplicity cannot satisfy
reason. Thought dissolves them and makes
them return to a single divinity. Moreover,
the gods do not remain in their eternal
repose; they enter into action, take
part in the interests, in the passions, and
mingle in the collisions of human life.
The multitude of relations in which they
are engaged, as actors in this drama, destroys
their divine majesty; contradicts
their grandeur, their dignity, their beauty.
In the true ideal itself, that of sculpture,
we observe something, the inanimate, impassive,
cold, a serious air of silent mournfulness,
which indicates that something
higher weighs them down—destiny, supreme
unity, blind divinity, the immutable
fate to which gods and men are alike
subject.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>But the principal cause is, that absolute
necessity making no integral part of their
personality, and being foreign to them, the
particular individual side is no longer restrained
in its downward course; it is developed
more and more without hindrance
and without limit. They suffer themselves
to be drawn into the external accidents of
human life, and fall into all the imperfections
of anthropomorphism. Hence the
ruin of these beautiful divinities of art is
inevitable. The moral consciousness turns
away from them and rejects them. The
gods, it is true, are ethical persons, but
under the human and corporeal form. Now,
true morality appears only in the conscience,
and under a purely spiritual form.
The point of view of the beautiful is neither
that of religion nor that of morality. The
infinite, invisible spirituality is the divine
for the religious consciousness. For the
moral consciousness, the good is an idea,
a conception, an obligation, which commands
the sacrifice of sense. It is in vain,
then, to be enthusiastic over Greek art and
beauty, to admire those beautiful divinities.
The soul does not recognize herself
wholly in the object of her contemplation
or her worship. What she conceives as
the true ideal is a God, spiritual, infinite,
absolute, personal, endowed with moral
qualities, with justice, goodness, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is this whose image the gods of Greek
polytheism, in spite of their beauty, do
not present us.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the <i>transition</i> from the Greek
mythology to a new religion and a new
art, it could no longer be effected in the
domain of the imagination. In the origin
of Greek art, the transition appears under
the form of a conflict between the old and
the new gods, in the very domain of art
and imagination. Here it is upon the more
serious territory of history that this revolution
is accomplished. The new idea appears,
not as a revelation of art, nor under
the form of myth and of fable, but in
history itself, by the course of events, by
the appearance of God himself upon earth,
where he was born, lived, and arose from
the dead. Here is a field of ideas which
Art did not invent, and which it finds
too high for it. The gods of classic art
have existence only in the imagination;
they were visible only in stone and wood;
they were not both flesh and spirit. This
real existence of God in flesh and spirit,
Christianity, for the first time, showed in
the life and actions of a God present among
men. This transition cannot, then, be accomplished
in the domain of art, because
the God of revealed religion is the real
and living God. Compared with him, his
adversaries are only imaginary beings,
who cannot be taken seriously and meet
him on the field of history. The opposition
and conflict cannot, then, present the character
of a serious strife, and be represented
as such by Art or Poetry. Therefore,
always, whenever any one has attempted
to make of this subject, among moderns,
a poetic theme, he has done it in an impious
and frivolous manner, as in “The War
of the Gods,” by Parny.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, it would be useless
to regret, as has been frequently done in
prose and in verse, the loss of the Greek
ideal and pagan mythology, as being more
favorable to art and poetry than the Christian
faith, to which is granted a higher
moral verity, while it is regarded as inferior
in respect to art and the Beautiful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Christianity has a poetry and an art of
its own; an ideal essentially different from
the Greek ideal and art. Here all parallel
is superficial. Polytheism is anthropomorphism.
The gods of Greece are beautiful
divinities under the human form. As
soon as reason has comprehended God as
Spirit and as Infinite Being, there appear
other ideas, other sentiments, other demands,
which ancient art is incapable of
satisfying, to which it cannot attain, which
call, consequently, for a new art, a new
poetry. Thus, regrets are superfluous;
comparison has no more any significance,
it is only a text for declamation. What
one could object to seriously in Christianity,
its tendencies to mysticism, to asceticism,
which, in fact, are hostile to art, are
only exaggerations of its principle. But
the thought which constitutes the ground
of Christianity, and true Christian sentiment,
far from being opposed to art, are
very favorable to it. Hence springs up a
new art, inferior, it is true, in certain respects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>to antique art—in sculpture, for
example—but which is superior in other
respects, as is its idea when compared with
the pagan idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>In all this, we are making but a <i>resumé</i>
of the ideas of the author. We must do
him the justice to say, that wherever he
speaks of Christian art, he does it worthily,
and exhibits a spirit free from all sectarian
prejudice.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we cast, meanwhile, a glance at the
external causes which have brought about
this decadence, it is easy to discover them
in the situations of ancient society, which
prophesy the downfall of both art and
religion. We discover the vices of that
social order where the state was everything,
the individual nothing by himself.
This is the radical vice of the Greek state.
In such an identification of man and the
state, the rights of the individual are
ignored. The latter, then, seeks to open
for himself a distinct and independent
way, separates himself from the public
interest, pursues his own ends, and finally
labors for the ruin of the state. Hence
the egoism which undermines this society
little by little, and the ever-increasing excesses
of demagoguism.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, there arises in the
souls of the best a longing for a higher
freedom in a state organized upon the
basis of justice and right. In the meantime
man falls back upon himself, and
deserting the written law, religious and
civil, takes his conscience for the rule of
his acts. Socrates marks the advent of
this idea. In Rome, in the last years of
the republic, there appears, among energetic
spirits, this antagonism and this detachment
from society. Noble characters
present to us the spectacle of private virtues
by the side of feebleness and corruption
in public morals.</p>

<p class='c006'>This protest of moral consciousness
against the increasing corruption finds expression
in art itself; it creates a form of
poetry which corresponds to it, <i>satire</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to Hegel, <i>satire</i>, in fact, belongs
peculiarly to the Romans; it is at
least the distinctive and original characteristic,
the salient feature, of their poetry
and literature. “The spirit of the Roman
world is the dominance of the dead letter,
the destruction of beauty, the absence of
serenity in manners, the ebbing of the
domestic and natural affections—in general,
the sacrifice of individuality, which
devotes itself to the state, the tranquil
greatness in obedience to law. The principle
of this political virtue, in its frigid
and austere rudeness, subdued national
individualities abroad, while at home the
law was developed with the same rigor
and the same exactitude of forms, even to
the point of attaining perfection. But this
principle was contrary to true art. So one
finds at Rome no art which presents a character
of beauty, of liberty, of grandeur.
The Romans received and learned from
the Greeks sculpture, painting, music,
epic lyric and dramatic poetry. What is
regarded as indigenous among them is the
comic farces, the <i>fescennines</i> and <i>atellanes</i>.
The Romans can claim as belonging to
them in particular only the forms of art
which, in their principle, are prosaic, such
as the didactic poem. But before all we
must place satire.”</p>
<h4 class='c012'>III. Of Romantic Art.</h4>
<p class='c005'>This expression, employed here to designate
modern art, in its opposition to Greek
or classic art, bears nothing of the unfavorable
sense which it has in our language
and literature, where it has become
the synonym of a liberty pushed even to
license, and of a contempt for all law.
Romantic art, which, in its highest development,
is also Christian art, has laws and
principles as necessary as classic art. But
the idea which it expresses being different,
its conditions are also; it obeys other
rules, while observing those that are the
basis of all art and the very essence of the
beautiful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hegel, in a general manner, thus characterizes
this form of art, contrasting it
with antique art, the study of which we
have just left.</p>

<p class='c006'>In classic art, the spirit constitutes the
content of the representation; but it is
combined with the sensuous or material
form in such a manner that it is harmonized
perfectly with it, and does not surpass
it. Art reached its perfection when it accomplished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>this happy accord, when the
spirit idealized nature and made of it a
faithful image of itself. It is thus that
classic art was the perfect representation
of the ideal, the reign of beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there is something higher than the
beautiful manifestation of spirit under the
sensuous form. The spirit ought to abandon
this accord with nature, to retire into
itself, to find the true harmony in its own
world, the spiritual world of the soul and
the conscience. Now, that development
of the spirit, which not being able to
satisfy itself in the world of sense, seeks
a higher harmony in itself, is the fundamental
principle of romantic art.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here beauty of form is no longer the
supreme thing; beauty, in this sense, remains
something inferior, subordinate; it
gives place to the spiritual beauty which
dwells in the recesses of the soul, in the
depths of its infinite nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now in order thus to take possession of
itself, it is essential that spirit have a consciousness
of its relation to God, and of
its union with Him; that not only the divine
principle reveal itself under a form
true and worthy of it, but that the human
soul, on its part, lift itself toward God,
that it feel itself filled with His essence,
that the Divinity descend into the bosom
of humanity. The anthropomorphism of
Greek thought ought to disappear, in order
to give place to anthropomorphism of a
higher order.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence all the divinities of polytheism
will be absorbed in a single Deity. God
has no longer anything in common with
those individual personages who had their
attributes and their distinct rôles, and
formed a whole, free, although subject to
destiny.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the same time God does not remain
shut up in the depths of his being; he
appears in the real world also; he opens
his treasures and unfolds them in creation.
He is, notwithstanding, revealed less in
nature than in the moral world, or that of
liberty. In fine, God is not an ideal, created
by the imagination; he manifests
himself under the features of living humanity.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we compare, in this respect, romantic
art with classic art, we see that Sculpture
no longer suffices to express this idea. We
should vainly seek in the image of the
gods fashioned by sculpture that which announces
the true personality, the clear
consciousness of self and reflected will.
In the external this defect is betrayed by
the absence of the eye, that mirror of the
soul. Sculpture is deprived of the glance,
the ray of the soul emanating from within.
On the other hand, the spirit entering
into relation with external objects, this
immobility of sculpture no longer responds
to the longing for activity, which calls for
exercise in a more extended career. The
representation ought to embrace a vaster
field of objects, and of physical and moral
situations.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the manner in which this principle
is developed and realized, romantic art
presents certain striking differences from
antique art.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, as has been said, instead
of the ideal divinities, which exist
only for the imagination, and are only human
nature idealized, it is God himself
who makes himself man, and passes
through all the phases of human life, birth,
suffering, death, and resurrection. Such
is the fundamental idea which art represents,
even in the circle of religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The result of this religious conception
is to give also to art, as the principal
ground of its representations, strife, conflict,
sorrow and death, the profound grief
which the nothingness of life, physical
and moral suffering, inspire. Is not all
this, in fact, an essential part of the history
of the God-Man, who must be presented
as a model to humanity? Is it not
the means of being drawn near to God, of
resembling him, and of being united to
him? Man ought then to strip off his
finite nature, to renounce that which is a
mere nothing, and, through this negation
of the real life, propose to himself the
attainment of what God realized in his
mortal life.</p>

<p class='c006'>The infinite sorrow of this sacrifice, this
idea of suffering and of death, which were
almost banished from classic art, find, for
the first time, their necessary place in
Christian art. Among the Greeks death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>has no seriousness, because man attaches
no great importance to his personality and
his spiritual nature. On the other hand,
now that the soul has an infinite value,
death becomes terrible. Terror in the
presence of death and the annihilation of
our being, is imprinted strongly on our
souls. So also among the Greeks, especially
before the time of Socrates, the idea
of immortality was not profound; they
scarcely conceived of life as separable from
physical existence. In the Christian faith,
on the contrary, death is only the resurrection
of the spirit, the harmony of the soul
with itself, the true life. It is only by
freeing itself from the bonds of its earthly
existence that it can enter upon the possession
of its true nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such are the principal ideas which form
the religious ground of romantic or Christian
Art. In spite of some explanations
which recall the special system of the author,
one cannot deny that they are expressed
with power and truthfulness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, beyond the religious sphere,
there are developing certain interests
which belong to the mundane life, and
which form also the object of the representations
of art; they are the passions,
the collisions, the joys and the sufferings
which bear a terrestrial or purely human
character, but in which appear notwithstanding
the very principle which distinguishes
modern thought, to-wit: a more
vivid, more energetic, and more profound
sentiment of human <i>personality</i>, or, as the
author calls it, <i>subjectivity</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Romantic art differs no less from classic
art in the form or the mode of representation,
than in the ideas which constitute
the content of its works. And, in the first
place, one necessary consequence of the
preceding principle is, the new point of
view under which nature or the physical
world is viewed. The objects of nature
lose their importance; or, at least, they
cease to be divine. They have neither the
symbolic signification which oriental art
gave them, nor the particular aspect in
virtue of which they were animated and
personified in Greek art and mythology.
Nature is effaced; she retires to a lower
plane; the universe is condensed to a single
point, in the focus of the human soul.
That, absorbed in a single thought, the
thought of uniting itself to God, beholds
the world vanish, or regards it with an indifferent
eye. We see also appearing a
heroism wholly different from antique heroism,
a heroism of submission and resignation.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, on the other hand, precisely through
the very fact, that all is concentrated in
the focus of the human soul, the circle of
ideas is found to be infinitely enlarged.
The interior history of the soul is developed
under a thousand diverse forms, borrowed
from human life. It beams forth,
and art seizes anew upon nature, which
serves as adornment and as a theatre for
the activity of the spirit. Hence the history
of the human heart becomes infinitely
richer than it was in ancient art and poetry.
The increasing multitude of situations,
of interests, and of passions, forms
a domain as much more vast as spirit has
descended farther into itself. All degrees,
all phases of life, all humanity and its developments,
become inexhaustible material
for the representations of art.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, art occupies here only a
secondary place; as it is incapable of revealing
the content of the dogma, religion
constitutes still more its essential basis.
There is therefore preserved the priority
and superiority which faith claims over
the conceptions of the imagination.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this there results an important
consequence and a characteristic difference
for modern art. It is that in the representation
of sensuous forms, art no longer
fears to admit into itself the real with its
imperfections and its faults. The beautiful
is no longer the essential thing; the
ugly occupies a much larger place in
its creations. Here, then, vanishes that
ideal beauty which elevates the forms of
the real world above the mortal condition,
and replaces it with blooming youth.
This free vitality in its infinite calmness—this
divine breath which animates matter—romantic
art has no longer, for essential
aim, to represent these. On the contrary,
it turns its back on this culminating point
of classic beauty; it accords, indeed, to
the ugly a limitless rôle in its creations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>It permits all objects to pass into representation
in spite of their accidental character.
Nevertheless, those objects which
are indifferent or commonplace, have value
only so far as the sentiments of the soul
are reflected in them. But at the highest
point of its development art expresses only
spirit—pure, invisible spirituality. We
feel that it seeks to strip itself of all external
forms, to mount into a region superior
to sense, where nothing strikes the
eye, where no sound longer vibrates upon
the ear.</p>

<p class='c006'>Furthermore, we can say, on comparing
in this respect ancient with modern art,
that the fundamental trait of romantic or
Christian art is the musical element, the
lyric accent in poetry. The lyric accent
resounds everywhere, even in epic and
dramatic poetry. In the figurative arts
this characteristic makes itself felt, as a
breath of the soul and an atmosphere of
feeling.</p>

<p class='c006'>After having thus determined the general
character of romantic art, Hegel studies
it more in detail; he considers it, successively,
under a two-fold point of view, the
religious and the profane; he follows it in
its development, and points out the causes
which have brought about its decadence.
He concludes by some considerations upon
the present state of art and its future.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us analyze rapidly the principal ideas
contained in these chapters.</p>

<p class='c006'>1st. As to what concerns the religious
side, which we have thus far been considering,
Hegel, developing its principle, establishes
a parallel between the religious
idea in classic and romantic art; for romantic
art has also its ideal, which, as we
have seen already, differs essentially from
the antique idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>Greek beauty shows the soul wholly
identified with the corporeal form. In
romantic art beauty no more resides in
the idealization of the sensuous form, but
in the soul itself. Undoubtedly one ought
still to demand a certain agreement between
the reality and the idea; but the
determinate form is indifferent, it is not
purified from all the accidents of real existence.
The immortal gods in presenting
themselves to our eyes under the human
form, do not partake of its wants and
miseries. On the contrary, the God of
Christian art is not a solitary God, a stranger
to the conditions of mortal life;
he makes himself man, and shares the
miseries and the sufferings of humanity.
The representation of religious love is the
most favorable subject for the beautiful
creations of Christian art.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, in the first place, love in God is
represented by the history of Christ’s <i>redemption</i>,
by the various phases of his
life, of his passion, of his death, and of
his resurrection. In the second place, love
in man, the union of the human soul with
God, appears in the holy family, in the
maternal love of the Virgin, and in the
love of the disciples. Finally, love in humanity
is manifested by the spirit of the
Church, that is to say, by the Spirit of
God present in the society of the faithful,
by the return of humanity to God, death
to terrestrial life, martyrdom, repentance
and conversion, the miracles and the legends.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such are the principal subjects which
form the ground of religious art. It is
the Christian ideal in whatever in it is
most elevated. Art seizes it and seeks to
express it—but does this only imperfectly.
Art is here necessarily surpassed by the
religious thought, and ought to recognize
its own insufficiency.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we pass from the religious to the <i>profane
ideal</i>, it presents itself to us under
two different forms. The one, although
representing human personality, yet develops
noble and elevated sentiments,
which combine with moral or religious
ideas. The other shows us only persons
who display, in the pursuit of purely human
and positive interests, independence
and energy of character. The first is represented
by chivalry. When we come to
examine the nature and the principle of
the chivalric ideal, we see that what constitutes
its content is, in fact, <i>personality</i>.
Here, man abandons the state of inner
sanctification, the contemplative for the
active life. He casts his eyes about him
and seeks a theatre for his activity. The
fundamental principle is always the same,
the soul, the human person, pursuing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>infinite. But it turns toward another
sphere, that of action and real life. The
Ego is replete with self only, with its individuality,
which, in its eyes, is of infinite
value. It attaches little importance to general
ideas, to interests, to enterprises which
have for object general order. Three sentiments,
in the main, present this personal
and individual character, <i>honor</i>, <i>love</i>, and
<i>fidelity</i>. Moreover, separate or united,
they form, aside from the religious relationships
which can be reflected in them,
the true content of chivalry.</p>

<p class='c006'>The author analyzes these three sentiments;
he shows in what they differ from
the analogous sentiments or qualities in
antique art. He endeavors, above all, to
prove that they represent, in fact, the side
of human personality, with its infinite and
ideal character. Thus honor does not resemble
bravery, which exposes itself for a
common cause. Honor fights only to make
itself known or respected, to guarantee
the inviolability of the individual person.
In like manner <i>love</i>, also, which constitutes
the centre of the circle, is only the accidental
passion of one person for another
person. Even when this passion is idealized
by the imagination and ennobled by
depth of sentiment, it is not yet the ethical
bond of the family and of marriage.
Fidelity presents the moral character in a
higher degree, since it is disinterested; but
it is not addressed to the general good of
society in itself; it attaches itself exclusively
to the person of a master. Chivalric
fidelity understands perfectly well, besides,
how to preserve its advantages and
its rights, the independence and the honor
of the person, who is always only conditionally
bound. The basis of these three
sentiments is, then, free personality. This
is the most beautiful part of the circle
which is found beyond religion, properly
so-called. All here has for immediate
end, man, with whom we can sympathize
through the side of personal independence.
These sentiments are, moreover, susceptible
of being placed in connection with religion
in a multitude of ways, as they are
able to preserve their independent character.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This form of romantic art was developed
in the East and in the West, but especially
in the West, that land of reflection,
of the concentration of the spirit upon itself.
In the East was accomplished the
first expansion of liberty, the first attempt
toward enfranchisement from the finite.
It was Mahometanism which first swept
from the ancient soil all idolatry, and religions
born of the imagination. But it absorbed
this internal liberty to such a degree
that the entire world for it was effaced;
plunged in an intoxication of ecstacy,
the oriental tastes in contemplation the
delights of love, calmness, and felicity.”
(Page 456.)</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We have seen human personality developing
itself upon the theatre of real
life, and there displaying noble, generous
sentiments, such as honor, love and fidelity.
Meanwhile it is in the sphere of real
life and of purely human interests that liberty
and independence of character appear
to us. The ideal here consists only in energy
and perseverance of will, and passion
as well as <i>independence of character</i>. Religion
and chivalry disappear with their
high conceptions, their noble sentiments,
and their thoroughly ideal objects. On
the contrary, what characterizes the new
wants, is the thirst for the joys of the present
life, the ardent pursuit of human interests
in what in them is actual, determined,
or positive. In like manner, in the
figurative arts, man wishes objects to be
represented in their palpable and visible
reality.</p>

<p class='c006'>The destruction of classic art commenced
with the predominance of the agreeable,
and it ended with satire. Romantic art
ends in the exaggeration of the principle of
personality, deprived of a substantial and
moral content, and thenceforth abandoned
to caprice, to the arbitrary, to fancy and
excess of passion. There is left further to
the imagination of the poet only to paint
forcibly and with depth these characters;
to the artist, only to imitate the real; to the
spirit, to exhibit its rigor in piquant combinations
and contrasts.</p>

<p class='c006'>This tendency is revealed under three
principal forms: 1st, <i>Independence of individual
character</i>, pursuing its proper
ends, its particular designs, without moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>or religious aim; 2d, the exaggeration of
the chivalric principle, and the spirit of
<i>adventure</i>; 3d, the separation of the elements,
the union of which constitutes the
very idea of art, through the destruction of
art itself,—that is to say, the predilection
for common reality, <i>the imitation of the
real</i>, mechanical ability, caprice, fancy,
and <i>humor</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first of these three points furnishes
to Hegel the occasion for a remarkable estimate
of the characters of Shakspeare,
which represent, in an eminent degree,
this phase of the Romantic ideal. The
distinctive trait of character of the <i>dramatis
personæ</i> of Shakspeare is, in fact, the
energy and obstinate perseverance of a
will which is exclusively devoted to a specific
end, and concentrates all its efforts for
the purpose of realizing it. There is here
no question either of religion or of moral
ideas. They are characters placed singly
face to face with each other, and their
designs, which they have spontaneously
conceived, and the execution of which they
pursue with the unyielding obstinacy of
passion. Macbeth, Othello, Richard III.,
are such characters. Others, as Romeo,
Juliet, and Miranda, are distinguished by
an absorption of soul in a unique, profound,
but purely personal sentiment,
which furnishes them an occasion for displaying
an admirable wealth of qualities.
The most restricted and most common, still
interest us by a certain consistency in their
acts, a certain brilliancy, an enthusiasm,
a freedom of imagination, a spirit superior
to circumstances, which causes us to overlook
whatever there is common in their
action and discourse.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this class, where Shakspeare excels,
is extremely difficult to treat. To writers
of mediocrity, the quicksand is inevitable.
They risk, in fact, falling into the insipid,
the insignificant, the trivial, or the repulsive,
as a crowd of imitators have
proven.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been vouchsafed only to a few
great masters to possess enough genius
and taste to seize here the true and the
beautiful, to redeem the insignificance or
vulgarity of the content by enthusiasm
and talent, by the force and energy of their
pencil and by a profound knowledge of
human passions.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the characteristics of romantic
art is, that, in the religious sphere, the
soul, finding for itself satisfaction in itself,
has no need to develop itself in the external
world. On the other hand, when the
religious idea no longer makes itself felt,
and when the free will is no longer dependent,
except on itself, the <i>dramatis personæ</i>
pursue aims wholly individual in a world
where all appears arbitrary and accidental,
and which seems abandoned to itself and
delivered up to chance. In its irregular
pace, it presents a complication of events,
which intermingle without order and without
cohesion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, this is the form which events
affect in romantic, in opposition to classic
art, where the actions and events are bound
to a common end, to a true and necessary
principle which determines the form, the
character, and the mode of development of
external circumstances. In romantic art,
also, we find general interests, moral ideas;
but they do not ostensibly determine
events; they are not the ordering and regulating
principle. These events, on the
contrary, preserve their free course, and
affect an accidental form.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the character of the greater part
of the grand events in the middle ages, the
crusades, for example, which the author
names for this reason, and which were the
grand adventures of the Christian world.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever may be the judgment which
one forms upon the crusades and the different
motives which caused them to be
undertaken, it cannot be denied, that with
an elevated religious aim—the deliverance
of the holy sepulchre—there were mingled
other interested and material motives, and
that the religious and the profane aim did
not contradict nor corrupt the other. As
to their general form, the crusades present
utter absence of unity. They are undertaken
by masses, by multitudes, who enter
upon a particular expedition according to
their good pleasure, and their individual
caprice. The lack of unity, the absence
of plan and direction, causes the enterprises
to fail, and the efforts and endeavors
are wasted in individual exploits.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>In another domain, that of profane life,
the road is open also to a crowd of adventurers,
whose object is more or less imaginary,
and whose principle is love, honor,
or fidelity. To battle for the glory of a
name, to fly to the succor of innocence, to
accomplish the most marvellous things for
the honor of one’s lady, such is the motive
of the greater part of the beautiful exploits
which the romances of chivalry or
the poems of this epoch and subsequent
epochs celebrate.</p>

<p class='c006'>These vices of chivalry cause its ruin.
We find the most faithful picture of it in
the poems of Ariosto and Cervantes.</p>

<p class='c006'>But what best marks the destruction of
romantic art and of chivalry is the <i>modern
romance</i>, that form of literature which
takes their place. The romance is chivalry
applied to real life; it is a protest against
the real, it is the ideal in a society where all
is fixed, regulated in advance by laws, by
usages contrary to the free development
of the natural longings and sentiments of
the soul; it is the chivalry of common
life. The same principle which caused a
search for adventures throws the personages
into the most diverse and the most
extraordinary situations. The imagination,
disgusted with that which is, cuts
out for itself a world according to its fancy,
and creates for itself an ideal wherein it
can forget social customs, laws, positive
interests. The young men and young
women, above all, feel the want of such
aliment for the heart, or of such distraction
against <i>ennui</i>. Ripe age succeeds
youth; the young man marries and enters
upon positive interests. Such is also the
<i>dénoûement</i> of the greater part of romances,
where prose succeeds poetry, the real, the
ideal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The destruction of romantic art is announced
by symptoms still more striking,
by the <i>imitation of the real</i>, and the appearance
of the <i>humorous</i> style, which
occupies more and more space in art and
literature. The artist and the poet can
there display much talent, enthusiasm and
spirit; but these two styles are no less
striking indexes of an epoch of decadence.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is, above all, the humorous style which
marks this decadence, by the absence of
all fixed principle and all rule. It is a
pure play of the imagination which combines,
according to its liking, the most
different objects, alters and overturns relations,
tortures itself to discover novel and
extraordinary conceptions. The author
places himself above the subject, regards
himself as freed from all conditions imposed
by the nature of the content as well
as the form, and imagines that all depends
on his wit and the power of his genius. It
is to be observed, that what Hegel calls
the downfall of art in general, and of romantic
art in particular, is precisely what
we call the romantic school in the art and
literature of our time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such are the fundamental forms which
art presents in its historic development.
If the art of the <i>renaissance</i>, or modern
art properly so called, finds no place in
this sketch, it is because it does not constitute
an original and fundamental form.
The <i>renaissance</i> is a return to Greek art;
and as to modern art, it is allied to both
Greek and Christian.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it remains for us to present some
conclusions upon the future destiny of
art—a point of highest interest, to which
this review of the forms and monuments
of the past must lead. The conclusions of
the author, which we shall consider elsewhere,
are far from answering to what we
might have expected from so remarkable
a historic picture.</p>

<p class='c006'>What are, indeed, these conclusions?
The first is, that the rôle of art, to speak
properly, is finished—at least, its original
and distinct rôle. The circle of the ideas
and beliefs of humanity is completed. Art
has invested them with the forms which it
was capable of giving them. In the future,
it ought, then, to occupy a secondary place.
After having finished its independent career,
it becomes an obscure satellite of
science and philosophy, in which are absorbed
both religion and art. This thought
is not thus definitely formulated, but it is
clearly enough indicated. Art, in revealing
thought, has itself contributed to the
destruction of other forms, and to its own
downfall. The new art ought to be elevated
above all the particular forms which
it has already expressed. “Art ceases to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>be attached to a determinate circle of ideas
and forms; it consecrates itself to a new
worship, that of humanity. All that the
heart of man includes within its own immensity—its
joys and its sufferings, its
interests, its actions, its destinies—become
the domain of art.” Thus the content is
human nature; the form a free combination
of all the forms of the past. We shall
hereafter consider this new eclecticism in
art.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hegel points out, in concluding, a final
form of literature and poetry, which is the
unequivocal index of the absence of peculiar,
elevated and profound ideas, and of
original forms—that sentimental poetry,
light or descriptive, which to-day floods
the literary world and the drawing-rooms
with its verses; compositions without life
and without content, without originality
or true inspiration; a common-place and
vague expression of all sentiment, full of
aspirations and empty of ideas, where,
through all, there makes itself recognized
an imitation of some illustrious geniuses—themselves
misled in false and perilous
ways; a sort of current money, analogous
to the epistolary style. Everybody is poet;
and there is scarcely one true poet. “Wherever
the faculties of the soul and the forms
of language have received a certain degree
of culture, there is no person who cannot,
if he take the fancy, express in verse some
situation of the soul, as any one is in condition
to write a letter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a style, thus universally diffused,
and reproduced under a thousand forms,
although with different shadings, easily
becomes fastidious.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CHAPTER II.</h4>
<p class='c005'>We hope to see those necessities of
thought which underlie all Philosophical
systems. We set out to account for all the
diversities of opinion, and to see identity
in the world of thought. But necessity in
the realm of thought may be phenomenal.
If there be anything which is given out as
fixed, we must try its validity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many of the “impossibilities” of thought
are easily shown to rest upon ignorance of
psychological appliances. The person is
not able because he does not know <i>how</i>—just
as in other things. We must take
care that we do not confound the incapacity
of ignorance with the necessity of
thought. (The reader will find an example
of this in Sir Wm. Hamilton’s “Metaphysics,”
page 527.) One of these “incapacities”
arises from neglecting the
following:</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the first distinctions to be learned
by the student in philosophy is that between
the imaginative form of thinking
and <i>pure</i> thinking. The former is a
sensuous grade of thinking which uses
<i>images</i>, while the latter is a more developed
stage, and is able to think objects in and
for themselves. Spinoza’s statement of
this distinction applied to the thinking of
the Infinite—his “Infinitum imaginationis”
and “Infinitum actu vel rationis”—has
been frequently alluded to by those who
treat of this subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>At first one might suppose that when
finite things are the subject of thought, it
would make little difference whether the
first or second form of thinking is employed.
This is, however, a great error.
The Philosopher must always “think
things under the form of eternity” if he
would think the truth.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Imagination</i> pictures objects. It represents
to itself only the bounded. If it tries
to realize the conception of infinitude, it
represents a limited somewhat, and then
<i>Reflection</i> or the <i>Understanding</i> (a form of
thought lying between Imagination and
Reason) passes beyond the limits, and annuls
them. This process may be continued
indefinitely, or until <i>Reason</i> (or pure
thinking) comes in and solves the dilemma.
Thus we have a dialogue resulting
somewhat as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Imagination.</i> Come and see the Infinite
just as I have pictured it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span><i>Understanding.</i> [Peeping cautiously
about it.] Where is your frame? Ah! I
see it now, clearly. How is this! Your
frame does not include all. There is a
“beyond” to your picture. I cannot tell
whether you intend the inside or outside for
your picture of the Infinite, I see it on both.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Imag.</i> [Tries to extend the frame, but
with the same result as before.] I believe
you are right! I am well nigh exhausted
by my efforts to include the unlimited.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Un.</i> Ah! you see the Infinite is merely
the negative of the finite or positive. It is
the negative of those conditions which you
place there in order to have any representation
at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>[While the Understanding proceeds to
deliver a course of wise saws and moral
reflections on the “inability of the Finite to
grasp the Infinite,” sitting apart upon its
bipod—for tripod it has none, one of the
legs being broken—it self-complacently
and oracularly admonishes the human
mind to cultivate humility; Imagination
drops her brush and pencil in confusion at
these words. Very opportunely <i>Reason</i>
steps in and takes an impartial survey of
the scene.]</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Reason.</i> Did you say that the Infinite
is unknowable?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Un.</i> Yes. “To think is to limit, and
hence to think the Infinite is to limit it,
and thus to destroy it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Reason.</i> Apply your remarks to Space.
Is not Space infinite?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Un.</i> If I attempt to realize Space, I
conceive a bounded, but I at once perceive
that I have placed my limits <i>within</i> Space,
and hence my realization is inadequate.
The Infinite, therefore, seems to be a beyond
to my clear conception.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Reason.</i> Indeed! When you reflect on
Space do you not perceive that it is of
such a nature that it can be limited only
by itself? Do not all its limits imply
Space to exist in?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Un.</i> Yes, that is the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Reason.</i> I do not see the “difficulty.”
If Space can be limited only by itself, its
limit continues it, instead of bounding it.
Hence it is universally continuous or infinite.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Un.</i> But a mere negative.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Reason.</i> No, not a mere negative, but
the negative of all negation, and hence
truly affirmative. It is the exhibition of
the utter impossibility of any negative to
it. All attempts to limit it, continue it.
It is its own other. Its negative is itself.
Here, then, we have a truly affirmative infinite
in contradistinction to the <i>negative</i>
infinite—the “infinite progress” that you
and Imagination were engaged upon when
I came in.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Un.</i> What you say seems to me a distinction
in words merely.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Reason.</i> Doubtless. All distinctions
are merely in words until one has learned
to see them independent of words. But
you must go and mend that tripod on which
you are sitting; for how can one think at
ease and exhaustively, when he is all the
time propping up his basis from without?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Un.</i> I cannot understand you. [Exit.]</p>
<p class='c005'><i>Note.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>It will be well to consider what application
is to be made of these distinctions to
the mind itself, whose form is consciousness.
In self-knowing, or consciousness,
the subject knows itself—it is its own object.
Thus in this phase of activity we
have the affirmative Infinite. The subject
is its own object—is continued by its other
or object. This is merely suggested here—it
will be developed hereafter.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CHAPTER III.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In the first chapter we attained—or at
least made the attempt to attain—some insight
into the relation which Mind bears
to Time and Space. It appeared that
Mind is a <i>Transcendent</i>, i. e. something
which Time and Space inhere in, rather
than a somewhat, conditioned by them.
Although this result agrees entirely with
the religious instincts of man, which assert
the immortality of the soul, and the unsubstantiality
of the existences within
Time and Space, yet as a logical result of
thinking, it seems at first very unreliable.
The disciplined thinker will indeed find the
distinctions “a priori and a posteriori” inadequately
treated; but his emendations
will only make the results there established
more wide-sweeping and conclusive.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>In the second chapter we learned caution
with respect to the manner of attempting
to realize in our minds the results of
thought. If we have always been in the
habit of regarding Mind as a property or
attribute of the individual, we have conceived
it not according to its true nature,
but have allowed Imagination to mingle its
activity in the thinking of that which is
of a universal nature. Thus we are prone
to say to ourselves: “How can a mere attribute
like Mind be the logical condition
of the solid realities of Space and Time?”
In this we have quietly assumed the whole
point at issue. No system of thinking
which went to work logically ever proved
the Mind to be an attribute; only very elementary
grades of thinking, which have
a way of assuming in their premises what
they draw out analytically in their conclusions,
ever set up this dogma. This
will become clearer at every step as we
proceed.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will now pursue a path similar to
that followed in the first chapter, and see
what more we can learn of the nature of
Mind. We will endeavor to learn more
definitely what constitutes its <i>a priori</i> activity,
in order, as there indicated, to
achieve our object. Thus our present
search is after the “Categories” and their
significance. Taking the word category
here in the sense of “a priori determination
of thought,” the first question is:
“Do any categories exist? Are there any
thoughts which belong to the nature of
mind itself?” It is the same question
that Locke discusses under the head of
“Innate ideas.”</p>
<h4 class='c012'>I.</h4>
<p class='c005'>“Every act of knowing or cognizing is
the translating of an unknown somewhat
into a known, as a scholar translates a new
language into his own.” If he did not already
understand one language, he could
never translate the new one. In the act of
knowing, the object becomes known in so
far as I am able to recognise predicates as
belonging to it. “This is <i>red</i>;” unless I
know already what “red” means, I do not
cognize the object by predicating <i>red</i> of it.
“Red is a color;” unless I know what
“color” means, I have not said anything
intelligible—I have not expressed an act of
cognition. The object becomes known to
us in so far as we recognize its predicates—and
hence we could never know anything
unless we had at least one predicate or conception
with which to commence. If we
have one predicate through which we cognize
some object, that act of cognition
gives us a new predicate; for it has dissolved
or “translated” a somewhat, that
before was unknown, into a known; the
“not-me” has, to that extent, become the
“me.” Without any predicates to begin
with, all objects would remain forever outside
of our consciousness. Even consciousness
itself would be impossible, for
the very act of self-cognition implies that
the predicate “myself” is well known.
It is an act of identification: “I am myself;”
the subject is, as predicate, completely
known or dissolved back into the
subject. I cognize myself as myself; there
is no alien element left standing over
against me. Thus we are able to say that
there must be an a priori category in order
to render possible any act of knowing
whatever. Moreover, we see that this
category must be identical with the <i>Ego</i>
itself, for the reason that the process of
cognition is at the same time a recognition;
it predicates only what it recognizes.
Thus, fundamentally, in knowing, Reason
knows itself. Self-consciousness is the
basis of knowledge. This will throw light
on the first chapter; but let us first confirm
this position by a psychological analysis.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>II.</h4>
<p class='c005'>What is the permanent element in
thought?—It can easily be found in language—its
external manifestation. Logic
tells us that the expression of thought involves
always a subject and predicate.
Think what you please, say what you
please, and your thought or assertion consists
of a subject and predicate—positive or
negative—joined by the copula, <i>is</i>. “Man
lives” is equivalent to “man is living.”
“Man” and “living” are joined by the
word “is.” If we abstract all content
from thought, and take its pure form in
order to see the permanent, we shall have
“is” the copula,—or putting a letter for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>subject and attribute, we shall have “<i>a</i> is
<i>a</i>,” (or “<i>a</i> is <i>b</i>,”) for the universal form
of thought. The mental act is expressed
by “is.” In this empty “is” we have the
category of pure Being, which is the
“summum genus” of categories. Any
predicate other than <i>being</i> will be found to
contain being <i>plus</i> determinations, and
hence can be subsumed under being. We
shall get new light on this subject if we
examine the ordinary doctrine of <i>explanation</i>.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>III.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In order to explain something, we subsume
it under a more general. Thus we
say: “Horse is an animal;” and, “An animal
is an organic being,” &amp;c. A definition
contains not only this subsumption,
but also a statement of the specific difference.
We define <i>quadruped</i> by subsuming
it, (“It is an animal”) and giving the specific
difference (“which has four feet”).</p>

<p class='c006'>As we approach the “summum genus,”
the predicates become more and more
empty; “they become more <i>extensive</i> in
their application, and less <i>comprehensive</i>
in their content.” Thus they approach
pure simplicity, which is attained in the
“summum genus.” This pure simple,
which is the limit of subsumption and abstraction,
is pure Being—Being devoid of
all determinateness. When we have arrived
at Being, subsuming becomes simple
identifying—Being is Being, or <i>a</i> is <i>a</i>—and
this is precisely the same activity that
we found self-consciousness to consist of
in our first analysis, (<span class='fss'>I.</span>) and the same activity
that we found all mental acts to consist
of in our second analysis, (<span class='fss'>II.</span>).</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IV.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Therefore, we may affirm on these
grounds, that the “summum genus,” or
primitive category, is the Ego itself in its
simplest activity as the “is” (or pure
<i>being</i> if taken substantively).</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus it happens that when the Mind
comes to cognize an object, it must first of
all recognize itself in it in its simplest activity,—it
must know that the object <i>is</i>.
We cannot know anything else of an object
without presupposing the knowledge
of its <i>existence</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this point it is evident that this category
is not derived from experience in the
sense of <i>an impression from without</i>. It
is the activity of the Ego itself, and is its
(the <i>Ego’s</i>) first self-externalization (or its
first becoming object to itself—its first act
of self-consciousness). The essential activity
of the Ego itself consists in recognizing
itself, and this involves self-separation,
and then the annulling of this separation
in the same act. For in knowing
myself as an object I separate the Ego
from itself, but in the very act of <i>knowing</i>
it I make it identical again. Here are
two negative processes involved in knowing,
and these are indivisibly one:—first,
the negative act of separation—secondly,
the negative act of annulling the separation
by the act of recognition. That the
application of categories to the external
world is a process of self-recognition, is
now clear: we know, in so far as we recognize
predicates in the object,—we say “The
Rose <i>is</i>, it is <i>red</i>, it is <i>round</i>, it is <i>fragrant</i>,
&amp;c.” In this we separate what belongs
to the rose from it, and place it outside
of it, and then, through the act of predication,
unite it again. “The Rose <i>is</i>”
contains merely the recognition of being
but being is separated from it and joined
to it in the act of predication. Thus we
see that the fundamental act of self-consciousness,
which is a self-separation and
self-identification united in one act of recognition,—we
see that this fundamental
act is repeated in all acts of knowing. We
do not know even the rose without separating
it from itself, and identifying the
two sides thus formed. (This contains a
deeper thought which we may suggest
here. That the act of knowing puts all
objects into this crucible, is an intimation
on its part that no object can possess true,
abiding being, without this ability to separate
itself from itself in the process of
self-identification. Whatever cannot do
this is no essence, but may be only an element
of a process in which it ceaselessly
loses its identity. But we shall recur to
this again.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Doubtless we could follow out this activity
through various steps, and deduce
all the categories of pure thought. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>is what Plato has done in part; what
Fichte has done in his Science of Knowledge,
(“Wissenschaftslehre”) and Hegel
in his Logic. A science of these pure intelligibles
unlocks the secret of the Universe;
it furnishes that “Royal Road”
to all knowledge; it is the far-famed Philosopher’s
Stone that alone can transmute
the base dross of mere talent into genius.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>V.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Let us be content if at the close of this
chapter we can affirm still more positively
the conclusions of our first. Through a
consideration of the a priori knowledge of
Time and Space, and their logical priority,
as conditions, to the world of experience,
we inferred the transcendency of Mind.
Upon further investigation, we have now
discovered that there are other forms of
the Mind more primordial than Space and
Time, and more essentially related to its
activity; for all the categories of pure
thought—Being, Negation, &amp;c.,—are applicable
to Space and to Time, and hence
more universal than either of them alone;
these categories of pure thought, moreover,
as before remarked, could never have been
derived from experience. Experience is
not possible without presupposing these
predicates. “They are the tools of intelligence
through which it cognizes.” If we
hold by this stand-point exclusively, we
may say, with Kant, that we furnish the
subjective forms in knowing, and for this
reason cannot know the “thing in itself.”
If these categories are merely subjective—i. e.
given in the constitution of the Mind
itself—and we do not know what the “thing
in itself” may be, yet we can come safely
out of all skepticism here by considering
the universal nature of these categories or
“forms of the mind.” For if Being, Negation
and Existence are forms of mind
and purely subjective, so that they do not
belong to the “thing in itself,” it is evident
that such an object cannot <i>be</i> or <i>exist</i>,
or in any way have validity, either positively
or negatively. Thus it is seen from
the nature of mind here exhibited, that
Mind is the <i>noumenon</i> or “thing in itself”
which Philosophy seeks, and thus our third
chapter confirms our first.</p>
<p class='c005'><i>Note.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The <span class='sc'>Materialism</span> of the present day holds
that thought is a modification of force,
correlated with heat, light, electricity,
&amp;c., in short, that organization produces
ideas. If so, we are placed within a narrow
idealism, and can only say of what is
held for <i>truth</i>: “I am so correlated as to
hold this view,—I shall be differently correlated
to-morrow, perhaps, and hold
another view.” Yet in this very statement
the Ego takes the stand-point of universality—it
speaks of possibilities—which it
could never do, were it merely a correlate.
For to hold a possibility is to be able to
annul in thought the limits of the real,
and hence to elevate itself to the point of
universality. But this is <i>self</i>-correlation;
we have a movement in a circle, and hence
self-origination, and hence a spontaneous
fountain of force. The Mind, in conceiving
of the possible, annuls the real, and
thus creates its own motives; its acting according
to motives, is thus acting according
to its own acts—an obvious circle again.</p>

<p class='c006'>In fine, it is evident that the idealism
which the correlationist logically falls into
is as strict as that of any school of professed
idealism which he is in the habit of condemning.
The <i>persistent force</i> is the general
<i>idea</i> of force, not found as any <i>real</i> force,
for each <i>real</i> force is individualized in some
particular way. But it is evident that a particular
force cannot be correlated with <i>force
in general</i>, but only with a special form
like itself. But the general force is the
only abiding one—each particular one is
in a state of transition into another—a
perpetual losing of individuality. Hence
the true abiding force is not a <i>real</i> one existing
objectively, but only an <i>ideal</i> one
existing subjectively in thought. But
through the fact that thought can seize the
true and abiding which can exist for itself
nowhere else, the correlationist is bound
to infer the transcendency of Mind just
like the idealist. Nay, more, when he
comes to speak considerately, he will say
that Mind, for the very reason that it
thinks the true, abiding force, cannot be
correlated with any determined force.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>CHAPTER IV.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Philosophers usually begin to construct
their systems in full view of their final
principle. It would be absurd for one to
commence a demonstration if he had no
clear idea of what he intended to prove.
From the final principle the system must
be worked back to the beginning in the
Philosopher’s mind before he can commence
his demonstration. Usually the order of
demonstration which he follows, is not the
order of discovery; in such case his system
proceeds by external reflections. All
mathematical proof is of this order. One
constructs his demonstration to lead from
the known to the unknown, and uses many
intermediate propositions that do not of
necessity lead to the intended result.
With another theorem in view, they might
be used for steps to that, just as well. But
there is a certain inherent development in
all subjects when examined according to
the highest method, that will lead one on to
the exhaustive exposition of all that is involved
therein. This is called the <i>dialectic</i>.
This dialectic movement cannot be
used as a philosophic instrument, unless
one has seen the deepest <i>aperçu</i> of Science;
if this is not the case, the dialectic will
prove merely destructive and not constructive.
It is therefore a mistake, as has been
before remarked, to attempt to introduce
the beginner of the study of Philosophy
at once into the dialectic. The content of
Philosophy must be first presented under
its sensuous and reflective forms, and a
gradual progress established. In this chapter
an attempt will be made to approach
again the ultimate principle which we have
hitherto fixed only in a general manner as
<i>Mind</i>. We will use the method of external
reflection, and demonstrate three propositions:
1. There is an independent being;
2. That being is self-determined; 3.
Self-determined being is in the form of
personality, i. e. is an <i>Ego</i>.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>I.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. Dependent being, implying its complement
upon which it depends, cannot be
explained through itself, but through that
upon which it depends.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. This being upon which it depends
cannot be also a dependent being, for the
dependent being has no support of its own
to lend to another; all that it has is borrowed.
“A chain of dependent beings
collapses into one dependent being. Dependence
is not converted into independence
by mere multiplication.”</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The dependent, therefore, depends
upon the independent, and has its explanation
in it. Since all being is of one kind
or the other, it follows that all being is independent,
or a complemental element of
it. Reciprocal dependence makes an independent
including whole, which is the
<i>negative unity</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Definition.</i>—One of the most important
implements of the thinker is the comprehension
of “negative unity.” It is a
unity resulting from the reciprocal cancelling
of elements; e. g. <i>Salt</i> is the negative
unity of <i>acid</i> and <i>alkali</i>. It is called <i>negative</i>
because it negates the independence
of the elements within it. In the negative
unity <i>Air</i>, the elements oxygen and nitrogen
have their independence negated.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>II.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. The independent being cannot exist
without determinations. Without these,
it could not distinguish itself or be distinguished
from nought.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Nor can the independent being be determined
(i. e. limited or modified in any
way) from without, or through another.
For all that is determined through another
is a dependent somewhat.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Hence the independent being can be
only a self-determined. If self-determined,
it can exist through itself.</p>
<p class='c005'><i>Note.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Spinoza does not arrive at the third position,
but, after considering the second,
arrives at the first one, and concludes,
since determination through another makes
a somewhat <i>finite</i>, that the independent
being must be <i>undetermined</i>. He does not
happen to discover that there is another
kind of determination, to-wit, self-determination,
which can consist with independence.
The method that he uses makes
it entirely an accidental matter with him
that he discovers what speculative results
he does—the dialectic method would lead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>inevitably to self-determination, as we
shall see later. It is Hegel’s <i>aperçu</i> that
we have in the third position; with Spinoza
the independent being remained an
undetermined <i>substance</i>, but with Hegel it
became a self-determining <i>subject</i>. All
that Spinoza gets out of his substance he
must get in an arbitrary manner; it does
not follow from its definition that it shall
have modes and attributes, but the contrary.
This <i>aperçu</i>—that the independent
being, i. e. every really existing, separate
entity, is self-determined—is the central
point of speculative philosophy. What
self-determination involves, we shall see
next.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>III.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. Self-determination implies that the
<i>constitution</i> or <i>nature</i> be self-originated.
There is nothing about a self-determined
that is created by anything without.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Thus self-determined being exists
dually—it is (<i>a</i>) as <i>determining</i> and (<i>b</i>) as
<i>determined</i>. (<i>a</i>) As determining, it is the
active, which contains merely the possibility
of determinations; (<i>b</i>) as determined, it
is the passive result—the matter upon
which the subject acts.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. But since both are the same being,
each side returns into itself:—(<i>a</i>) as determining
or active, it acts only upon its
own determining, and (<i>b</i>) as passive or determined,
it is, as result of the former, the
self-same active itself. Hence its movement
is a movement of self-recognition—a
positing of distinction which is cancelled
in the same act. (In self-recognition
something is made an object, and identified
with the subject in the same act.)
Moreover, the determiner, on account of
its pure generality, (i. e. its having no
concrete determinations as yet,) can only
be <i>ideal</i>—can only exist as the <i>Ego</i> exists
in thought; not as a <i>thing</i>, but as a <i>generic</i>
entity. The passive side can exist only
as the self exists in consciousness—as
that which is in opposition and yet in
identity at the same time. No finite existence
could endure this contradiction,
for all such must possess a <i>nature</i> or <i>constitution</i>
which is self-determined; if not,
each finite could negate all its properties
and qualities, and yet remain itself—just
as the person does when he makes abstraction
of all, in thinking of the <i>Ego</i> or pure
self.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we find again our former conclusion.—All
finite or dependent things must
originate in and depend upon independent
or absolute being, which must be an <i>Ego</i>.
The <i>Ego</i> has the form of Infinitude (see
chapter II—<i>the infinite is its own other</i>).</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Resumé.</i> The first chapter states the
premises which Kant lays down in his
Transcendental Æsthetic, (Kritik der Reinen
Vernunft) and draws the true logical
conclusions which are positive and not
negative, as he makes them. The second
chapter gives the Spinozan distinction of
the Infinite of the Imagination and Infinite
of Reason. The third chapter gives the
logical results which Kant should have
drawn from his Transcendental Logic.
The fourth chapter gives Spinoza’s fundamental
position logically completed, and is
the great fundamental position of Plato,
Aristotle and Hegel, with reference to the
Absolute.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>MUSIC AS A FORM OF ART. <br /> [Read before the St. Louis Art Society, February, 1867.]</h3>
<h4 class='c012'>I. Upon Art-Criticism.</h4>
<p class='c005'>A work of art is the product of the inspired
moment of the artist. It is not to
be supposed that he is able to give an account
of his work in the terms of the understanding.
Hence the artist is not in a
strict sense a critic. The highest order of
criticism must endeavor to exhibit the
unity of the work by showing how the
various motives unfold from the central
thought. Of course, the artist must be
rare who can see his work doubly—first
sensuously, and then rationally. Only
some Michael Angelo or Goethe can do
this. The common artist sees the sensuous
form as the highest possible revelation—to
him his <i>feeling</i> is higher than the intellectual
vision. And can we not all—critics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>as well as artists—sympathize with
the statement that the mere calculating
intellect, the cold understanding, “all
light and no heat,” can never rise into the
realm where art can be appreciated? It is
only when we contemplate the truly speculative
intellect—which is called “love” by
the mystics, and by Swedenborg “Love
and wisdom united in a Divine Essence,”—that
we demur at this supreme
elevation of feeling or sentiment. The
art critic must have all the feeling side of
his nature aroused, as the first condition of
his interpretation; and, secondly, he must
be able to dissolve into thought the
emotions which arise from that side. If
feeling were more exalted than thought,
this would be impossible. Such, however,
is the view of such critics as the Schlegels,
who belong to the romantic school. They
say that the intellect considers only abstractions,
while the heart is affected by
the concrete whole. “Spectres and goitred
dwarfs” for the intellect, but “beauty’s
rose” for the feeling heart. But this
all rests on a misunderstanding. The true
art critic does not undervalue feeling. It
is to him the essential basis upon which
he builds. Unless the work of art affects
his feelings, he has nothing to think about;
he can go no further; the work, to him, is
not a work of art at all. But if he is
aroused and charmed by it, if his emotional
nature is stirred to its depths, and
he feels inspired by those spiritual intimations
of Eternity which true art always
excites, then he has a content to work
upon, and this thinking of his, amounts
simply to a recognition in other forms, of
this eternal element, that glows through the
work of art.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence there is no collision between the
artist and the critic, if both are true to
their ideal.</p>

<p class='c006'>It certainly is no injury to the work of
art to show that it treats in some form the
Problem of Life, which is the mystery of
the Christian religion. It is no derogation
to Beethoven to show how he has
solved a problem in music, just as Shakspeare
in poetry, and Michael Angelo in
painting. Those who are content with the
mere feeling, we must always respect if
they really have the true art feeling, just
as we respect the simple piety of the uneducated
peasant. But we must not therefore
underrate the conscious seizing of
the same thing,—not place St. Augustine
or Martin Luther below the simple-minded
peasant. Moreover, as our society has for
its aim the attainment of an insight into
art <i>in general</i>, and not the exclusive enjoyment
of any particular art, it is all the
more important that we should hold by the
only connecting link—the only universal
element—<i>thought</i>. For thought has not
only universal <i>content</i>, like feeling, but
also universal <i>form</i>, which feeling has not.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another reason that causes persons to
object to art interpretation, is perhaps
that such interpretation reminds them of
the inevitable moral appended <i>ad nauseam</i>
to the stories that delighted our
childhood. But it must be remembered
that these morals are put forward as the
<i>object</i> of the stories. The art critic can
never admit for one moment that it is
the object of a work of art simply to be
didactic. It is true that all art is a means
of culture; but that is not its object. Its
object is to combine the idea with a sensuous
form, so as to embody, as it were, the
Infinite; and any motive external to the
work of art itself, is at once felt to be destructive
to it.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>II. Upon the Interpretation of Art.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. The Infinite is not manifested <i>within</i>
any particular sphere of finitude, but rather
exhibits itself in the collision of a Finite
with another Finite <i>without</i> it. For a
Finite must by its very nature be limited
from without, and the Infinite, therefore,
not only includes any given finite sphere,
but also its negation (or the other spheres
which joined to it make up the whole).</p>

<p class='c006'>2. “Art is the manifestation of the Infinite
in the Finite,” it is said. Therefore,
this must mean that art has for its province
the treatment of the collisions that
necessarily arise between one finite sphere
and another.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. In proportion as the collision portrayed
by art is comprehensive, and a type of
all collisions in the universe, is it a high
work of art. If, then, the collision is on a
small scale, and between low spheres, it is
not a high work of art.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>4. But whether the collision presented
be of a high order or of a low order, it
bears a general resemblance to every other
collision—the Infinite is always like itself
in all its manifestations. The lower the
collision, the more it becomes merely symbolical
as a work of art, and the less it
adequately presents the Infinite.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the lofty mountain peaks of Bierstadt,
which rise up into the regions of
clearness and sunshine, beyond the realms
of change, do this, only because of a force
that contradicts gravitation, which continually
abases them. The contrast of the
high with the low, of the clear and untrammelled
with the dark and impeded, symbolizes,
in the most natural manner, to
every one, the higher conflicts of spirit.
It strikes a chord that vibrates, unconsciously
perhaps, but, nevertheless, inevitably.
On the other hand, when we take the
other extreme of painting, and look at the
“Last Judgment” of Michael Angelo, or
the “Transfiguration” of Raphael, we find
comparatively no ambiguity; there the Infinite
is visibly portrayed, and the collision
in which it is displayed is evidently of the
highest order.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Art, from its definition, must relate
to Time and Space, and in proportion as
the grosser elements are subordinated and
the spiritual adequately manifested, we
find that we approach a form of art wherein
the form and matter are both the products
of spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we have arts whose matter is taken
from (<i>a</i>) <i>Space</i>, (<i>b</i>) <i>Time</i>, and (<i>c</i>) <i>Language</i>
(the product of Spirit).</p>

<p class='c006'>Space is the grossest material. We have
on its plane, I. Architecture, II. Sculpture,
and III. Painting. (In the latter, color
and perspective give the artist power to
represent distance and magnitude, and
internality, without any one of them, in
fact. Upon a piece of ivory no larger than
a man’s hand a “Heart of the Andes”
might be painted.) In Time we have
IV. Music, while in Language we have
V. Poetry (in the three forms of Epic, Lyric,
and Dramatic) as the last and highest
of the forms of Art.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. An interpretation of a work of art
should consist in a translation of it into
the form of science. Hence, first, one must
seize the general content of it—or the collision
portrayed. Then, secondly, the form
of art employed comes in, whether it be
Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Music,
or Poetry. Thirdly, the relation which
the content has to the form, brings out the
superior merits, or the limits and defects
of the work of art in question. Thus, at
the end, we have universalized the piece
of art—digested it, as it were. A true interpretation
does not destroy a work of
art, but rather furnishes a guide to its
highest enjoyment. We have the double
pleasure of immediate sensuous enjoyment
produced by the artistic execution, and the
higher one of finding our rational nature
mirrored therein so that we recognize the
eternal nature of Spirit there manifested.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. The peculiar nature of music, as contrasted
with other arts, will, if exhibited,
best prepare us for what we are to expect
from it. The less definitely the mode of
art allows its content to be seized, the
wider may be its application. Landscape
painting may have a very wide scope for
its interpretation, while a drama of Goethe
or Shakspeare definitely seizes the particulars
of its collision, and leaves no doubt
as to its sphere. So in the art of music,
and especially instrumental music. Music
does not portray an object directly, like
the plastic arts, but it calls up the internal
feeling which is caused by the object itself.
It gives us, therefore, a reflection of our
impressions excited in the immediate contemplation
of the object. Thus we have a
reflection of a reflection, as it were.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since its material is Time rather than
Space, we have this contrast with the
plastic arts: Architecture, and more especially
Sculpture and Painting, are obliged
to select a special moment of time for
the representation of the collision. As
Goethe shows in the Laocoon, it will not
do to select a moment at random, but that
point of time must be chosen in which the
collision has reached its height, and in
which there is a tension of all the elements
that enter the contest on both sides. A
moment earlier, or a moment later, some
of these elements would be eliminated from
the problem, and the comprehensiveness of
the work destroyed. When this proper moment
is seized in Sculpture, as in the Laocoon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>we can see what has been before the
present moment, and easily tell what will
come later. In Painting, through the fact
that coloring enables more subtle effects to
be wrought out, and deeper internal movements
to be brought to the surface, we are
not so closely confined to the “supreme
moment” as in Sculpture. But it is in
Music that we first get entirely free from
that which confines the plastic arts. Since
its form is time, it can convey the whole
movement of the collision from its inception
to its conclusion. Hence Music is superior
to the Arts of Space, in that it can
portray the internal creative process, rather
than the dead results. It gives us the
content in its whole process of development
in a <i>fluid</i> form, while the Sculptor
must fix it in a <i>frigid</i> form at a certain
stage. Goethe and others have compared
Music to Architecture—the latter is “frozen
Music”; but they have not compared it to
Sculpture nor Painting, for the reason
that in these two arts there is a possibility
of seizing the form of the individual more
definitely, while in Architecture and Music
the point of repose does not appear as
the human form, but only as the more general
one of self-relation or harmony. Thus
quantitative ratios—mathematical laws—pervade
and govern these two forms of
Art.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. Music, more definitely considered,
arises from vibrations, producing waves in
the atmosphere. The cohesive attraction
of some body is attacked, and successful
resistance is made; if not, there is no vibration.
Thus the feeling of victory over
a foreign foe is conveyed in the most elementary
tones, and this is the distinction
of <i>tone</i> from <i>noise</i>, in which there is the
irregularity of disruption, and not the
regularity of self-equality.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in the obedience of the whole
musical structure to its fundamental scale-note,
we have something like the obedience
of Architecture to Gravity. In order to
make an exhibition of Gravity, a pillar is
necessary; for the solid wall does not isolate
sufficiently the function of support.
With the pillar we can have exhibited the
effects of Gravity drawing down to the
earth, and of the support holding up the
shelter. The pillar in classic art exhibits
the equipoise of the two tendencies. In
Romantic or Gothic Architecture it exhibits
a preponderance of the aspiring tendency—the
soaring aloft like the plant to
reach the light—a contempt for mere gravity—slender
pillars seeming to be let down
from the roof, and to draw up something,
rather than to support anything. On the
other hand, in Symbolic Architecture, (as
found in Egypt) we have the overwhelming
power of gravity exhibited so as to crush
out all humanity—the Pyramid, in whose
shape Gravity has done its work. In Music
we have continually the conflict of these
two tendencies, the upward and downward.
The Music that moves upward and
shows its ground or point of repose in the
octave above the scale-note of the basis,
corresponds to the Gothic Architecture.
This aspiring movement occurs again and
again in chorals; it—like all romantic art—expresses
the Christian solution of the
problem of life.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>III. Beethoven’s Sonata in C sharp minor. <br /> (<i>Opus 27, No.</i> 2.)</h4>
<p class='c005'>The three movements of this sonata
which Beethoven called a <i>fantasie-sonata</i>,
are not arranged in the order commonly
followed. Usually sonatas begin with an
<i>allegro</i> or some quick movement, and pass
over to a slow movement—an <i>adagio</i>
or <i>andante</i>—and end in a quick movement.
The content here treated could not
allow this form, and hence it commences
with what is usually the second movement.
Its order is 1. <i>Adagio</i>, 2. <i>Allegretto</i>, 3. <i>Finale</i>
(presto agitato).</p>

<p class='c006'>(My rule with reference to the study of
art may or may not be interesting to others;
it is this:—always to select a masterpiece,
so recognized, and keep it before
me until it yields its secret, and in its light
I am able to see common-place to be what it
really is, and be no longer dazzled by it.
It requires faith in the commonly received
verdict of critics and an immense deal of
patience, but in the end one is rewarded
for his pains. Almost invariably I find
immediate impressions of uncultured persons
good for nothing. It requires long
familiarity with the best things to learn to
see them in their true excellence.)</p>

<p class='c006'>This sonata is called by the Austrians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the “Moonlight Sonata,” and this has become
the popular name in America. It is
said to have been written by Beethoven
when he was recovering from the disappointment
of his hopes in a love-episode
that had an unfortunate termination. (See
Marx’s “L. v. Beethoven, Leben und Schaffen.”
From this magnificent work of Art-Criticism,
I have drawn the outlines of the
following interpretation.) The object of
his affection was a certain young countess,
Julia Guicciardi; and it appears from
Beethoven’s letter to a friend at the time
(about 1800) that the affection was mutual,
but their difference in rank prevented
a marriage. When this sonata appeared
(in 1802) it was inscribed to her.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><i>Adagio.</i></h4>
<p class='c005'>The first movement is a soft, floating
movement, portraying the soul musing
upon a memory of what has affected it
deeply. The surrounding is dim, as
seen in moonlight, and the soul is lit up
by a reflected light—a glowing at the memory
of a bliss that is past. It is not strange
that this has been called the Moonlight
Sonata, just for this feeling of borrowed
light that pervades it. As we gaze into
the moon of memory, we almost forget the
reflection, and fancy that the sun of immediate
consciousness is itself present.
But anon a flitting cloudlet (a twinge of
bitter regret) obscures the pale beam, or a
glance at the landscape—not painted now
with colors as in the daytime, but only
<i>clare-obscure</i>—brings back to us the sense
of our separation from the day and the
real. Sadly the soft gliding movement
continues, and distant and more distant
grows the prospect of experiencing again
the remembered happiness. Only for a
passing moment can the throbbing soul
realize in its dreams once more its full
completeness, and the plaintive minor
changes to major; but the spectral form
of renunciation glides before its face, and
the soul subsides into its grief, and yields
to what is inevitable. Downward into the
depths fall its hopes; only a sepulchral
echo comes from the bass, and all is still.
Marx calls this “the song of the renouncing
soul.” It is filled with the feeling of
separation and regret; but its slow, dreamy
movement is not that of stern resolution,
which should accompany renunciation.
Accordingly we have</p>
<h4 class='c012'><i>Allegretto.</i></h4>
<p class='c005'>The present and real returns; we no longer
dwell on the past; “We must separate;
only this is left.” In this movement we
awake from the dream, and we feel the importance
of the situation. Its content is
“Farewell, then;” the phrase expressing
this, lingers in its striving to shake off the
grasp and get free. The hands will not let
go each other. The phrase runs into the
next and back to itself, and will not be cut
off. In the trio there seems to be the echoing
of sobs that come from the depth of the
soul as the sorrowful words are repeated.
The buried past still comes back and holds
up its happy hours, while the shadows of
the gloomy future hover before the two
renunciants!</p>

<p class='c006'>This movement is very short, and is followed
by the</p>
<h4 class='c012'><i>Finale</i> (<i>Presto agitato</i>).</h4>
<p class='c005'>“No grief of the soul that can be conquered
except through action,” says Goethe—and
Beethoven expresses the same conviction
in the somewhat sentimental correspondence
with the fair countess. This
third movement depicts the soul endeavoring
to escape from itself; to cancel its individualism
through contact with the real.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first movement found the being of
the soul involved with another—having,
as it were, lost its essence. If the being
upon which it depends reflects it back by a
reciprocal dependence, it again becomes
integral and independent. This cannot
be; hence death or renunciation. But
renunciation leaves the soul recoiling upon
its finitude, and devoid of the universality
it would have obtained by receiving its
being through another which reciprocally
depended upon it. Hence the necessity of
Goethe’s and Beethoven’s solution—the
soul must find surcease of sorrow through
action, through will, or practical self-determination.
<i>Man becomes universal in
his deed.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>How fiercely the soul rushes into the
world of action in this <i>Finale!</i> In its impetuosity
it storms through life, and ever
and anon falls down breathless before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>collision which it encounters in leaping the
chasms between the different spheres. In
its swoon of exhaustion there comes up
from the memory of the past the ghost of
the lost love that has all the while accompanied
him, though unnoticed, in his frantic
race. Its hollow tones reverberate
through his being, and he starts from his
dream and drowns his memory anew in the
storm of action. At times we are elevated
to the creative moment of the artist,
and feel its inspiration and lofty enthusiasm,
but again and again the exhausted
soul collapses, and the same abysmal crash
comes in at the bass each time. The
grimmest loneliness, that touches to the
core, comes intruding itself upon our rapture.
Only in the contest with the “last
enemy” we feel at length that the soul has
proved itself valid in a region where distinctions
of rank sunder and divide no
more.</p>

<p class='c006'>This solution is not quite so satisfactory
as could be desired. If we would realize the
highest solution, we must study the Fifth
Symphony, especially its second movement.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IV. Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, <br /> (<i>Part II.</i>)</h4>
<p class='c005'>Marx finds in this symphony the problem
so often treated by Beethoven—the collision
of freedom with fate. “Through
night to day, through strife to victory!”
Beethoven, in his conversation with
Schindler, speaking of the first “motive”
at the beginning, said, “Thus Fate knocks
at the door.” This knocking of Fate
comes in continually during the first movement.
“We have an immense struggle
portrayed. Life is a struggle—this seems
to be the content of this movement.” The
soul finds a solution to this and sings its
pæan of joy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the second movement (<i>andante</i>) we
have an expression of the more satisfactory
solution of the Problem of Life, which
we alluded to when speaking of the Sonata
above.</p>

<p class='c006'>It (“The storm-tossed soul”) has in
that consoling thought reached the harbor
of infinite rest—infinite rest in the sense
of an “activity which is a true repose.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The soul has found this solution, and
repeats it over to assure itself of its reality
(1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 2, 1—these are the notes
which express it). Then it wishes to make
the experience of the universality of this
solution—it desires to try its validity in
all the spheres where Fate ruled previously.
It sets out and ascends the scale three steps
at a time (5, 1, 1, 2, 3—1, 3, 3, 4, 5) it
reaches 5 of the scale, and ought to reach 8
the next time. It looks up to it as the celestial
sun which Gothic Architecture points
toward and aspires after. Could it only
get there, it would find true rest! But its
command of this guiding thought is not
yet quite perfect—it cannot wield it so as
to fly across the abyss and reach that place
of repose without a leap—a “mortal leap.”
For the ascent by threes has reached a
place where another three would bring it
to 7 of the scale—the point of absolute
unrest; to step four, is to contradict the
rhythm or method of its procedure. It
pauses, therefore, upon 5—it tries the next
three thoughtfully twice, and then, hearing
below once more the mocking tones of Fate,
it springs over the chasm and clutches the
support above, while through all the
spheres there rings the sound of exultation.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to reach the goal by a leap—to have
no bridge across the gulf at the end of the
road—is not a satisfactory solution of the
difficulty. Hence we have a manifold endeavor—a
striving to get at the true
method, which wanders at first in the
darkness, but comes at length to the light;
it gets the proper form for its idea, and
gives up its unwieldy method of threes (1,
2, 3—3, 4, 5), and ascends by the infinite
form of 1, 3, 5—3, 5, 8—5, 8, 3, &amp;c., which
gives it a complete access to, and control
over, all above and below.</p>

<p class='c006'>The complete self-equipoise expressed in
that solution which comes in at intervals
through the whole, and the bold application
of the first method, followed by the
faltering when it comes to the defect—the
grand exultation over the final discovery
of the true method—all these are indescribably
charming to the lover of music
almost the first time he listens to this symphony,
and they become upon repetition
more and more suggestive of the highest
that art can give.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>THE ALCHEMISTS. <br /> [“Remarks upon Alchemy and the Alchemists, showing that the Philosopher’s Stone was a Symbol.”—Published by James Miller, New York, 1867.]</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>We have referred in a previous article to
the transition of Religion into Speculative
Philosophy. The Mystics who present this
phase of thought, “express themselves, not
in those universal categories that the Spirit
of the race has formed in language for its
utterance, but they have recourse to symbols
more or less ambiguous, and of insufficient
universality to stand for the
Archetypes themselves.” The Alchemists
belong to this phase of spirit, and we propose
to draw from the little book named
at the head of our article, some of the evidences
of this position. It is there shown
that instead of the transmutation of metals,
the regeneration of man was in view.
Those much-abused men agreed that “The
highest wisdom consists in this,” (quoting
from the Arabic author, Alipili,) “for man
to know himself, because in him God has
placed his eternal Word, by which all
things were made and upheld, to be his
Light and Life, by which he is capable of
knowing all things, both in time and eternity.”
While they claim explicitly to have
as object of their studies the mysteries of
Spirit, they warn the reader against taking
their remarks upon the metals in a literal
sense, and speak of those who do so, as
being in error. They describe their processes
in such a way as to apply to man
alone; pains seem to have been taken to
word their descriptions so as to be utterly
absurd when applied to anything else. In
speaking of the “Stone,” they refer to
three states, calling them black, white and
red; giving minute descriptions of each,
so as to leave no doubt that man is represented,
first, as in a “fallen condition;”
secondly, in a “repenting condition;” and
thirdly, as “made perfect through grace.”
This subordination of the outer to the inner,
of the body to the soul, is the constantly
recurring theme. Instead of seeking
a thing not yet found—which would
be the case with a stone for the transmutation
of metals, they agree in describing
the “Stone” as already known. They refer
constantly to such speculative doctrines
as “Nature is a whole everywhere,” showing
that their subject possesses universality.
This metal or mineral is described
thus: “Minerals have their roots in the
air, their heads and tops in the earth. Our
Mercury is aërial; look for it, therefore, in
the air and the earth.” The author of the
work from which we quote the passage,
says by way of comment: “In this passage
‘Minerals’ and ‘our Mercury’ refer to
the same thing, and it is the subject of
Alchemy, the Stone; and we may remember
that Plato is said to have defined or
described <i>Man</i> as a growth having his root
in the air, his tops in the earth. Man
walks indeed upon the surface of the earth,
as if nothing impeded his vision of heaven;
but he walks nevertheless at the bottom of
the atmosphere, and between these two,
his <i>root</i> in air, he must work out his salvation.”
A great number of these “Hermetic
writers” established their reputation for
wit and wisdom by discoveries in the practical
world, and it is difficult to believe
that such men as Roger Bacon, Van Helmont,
Ramond Lulli, Jerome Cardan, Geber,
(“The Wise”), Avicenna, Albertus
Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, and others not
inferior, could have deceived themselves
as the modern theory implies, viz: that
they were searching a chemical recipe for
the manufacture of gold. The symbolic
form of statement was esteemed at that
time as the highest form of popular exposition
for the Infinite and the religious
problems concerning God, the Soul and the
Universe. It seems that those writers considered
such words as “God,” “Spirit,”
“Heaven,” and words of like deep import,
as not signifying the thing intended only
so far as the one who used them, comprehended
them. Thus, if God was spoken
of by one who sensuously imaged Him,
here was idolatry, and the second commandment
was broken. To the Platonist,
“God” was the name of the Absolute Universal,
and hence included <i>subject</i> as well
as <i>object</i> in thinking. Hence if one objectified
God by conceiving Him, he necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>limited God, or rather, had no real
knowledge of Him. Said Sextus, the
Pythagorean: “Do not investigate the
name of God, because you will not find it.
For everything which is called by a name,
receives its appellation from that which is
more worthy than itself, so that it is one
person that calls, and another that hears.
Who is it, therefore, that has given a name
to God? <i>God</i>, however, is not a name for
God, but an indication of what we conceive
of him.” From such passages we can see
why the Alchemists called this “Ineffable
One,” <i>Mercury</i>, <i>Luna</i>, <i>Sol</i>, <i>Argent vive</i>,
<i>Phœbus</i>, <i>Sulphur</i>, <i>Antimony</i>, <i>Elixir</i>, <i>Alcahest</i>,
<i>Salt</i>, and other whimsical names, letting
the predicates applied determine the
nature of what was meant. If a writer,
speaking of “Alcahest,” should say that it
is a somewhat that rises in the east, and
sets in the west, gives light to the earth,
and causes the growth of plants by its
heat, &amp;c., we should not misunderstand
his meaning—it would be giving us the nature
of the thing without the common
name. Every one attaches some sort of
significance to the words “Life,” “God,”
“Reason,” “Instinct,” &amp;c., and yet who
comprehends them? It is evident that in
most cases the word stands for the thing,
and hence when one speaks of such things
by name, the hearer yawns and looks listless,
as if he thought: “Well, I know all
about that—I learned that when a child, in
the Catechism.” The Alchemists (and
Du Fresnoy names nearly a thousand of
these prolific writers) determined that no
one should flatter himself that he knew the
nature of the subject before he saw the
predicates applied. Hence the strange
names about which such spiritual doctrines
were inculcated. “If we have concealed
anything,” says Geber, “ye sons of learning,
wonder not, for we have not concealed
it from you, but have delivered it in such
language as that it may be hid from evil
men, and that the unjust and vile might
not know it. But, ye sons of Truth, search,
and you shall find this most excellent gift
of God, which he has reserved for you.”</p>
<h3 class='c001'>EDITORIALS.</h3>
<h4 class='c012'>ORIGINALITY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>It is natural that in America more than
elsewhere, there should be a popular demand
for originality. In Europe, each
nation has, in the course of centuries, accumulated
a stock of its own peculiar creations.
America is sneered at for the lack
of these. We have not had time as yet to
develop spiritual capital on a scale to correspond
to our material pretensions.
Hence, we, as a people, feel very sensitive
on this point, and whenever any new literary
enterprise is started, it is met on
every hand by inquiries like these: “Is it
original, or only an importation of European
ideas?” “Why not publish something
indigenous?” It grows cynical at
the sight of erudition, and vents its spleen
with indignation: “Why rifle the graves
of centuries? You are no hyena! Does
not the spring bring forth its flowers, and
every summer its swarms of gnats? Why
build a bridge of rotten coffin planks, or
wear a wedding garment of mummy wrappage?
Why desecrate the Present, by offering
it time-stained paper from the
shelves of the Past?”</p>

<p class='c006'>In so far as these inquiries are addressed
to our own undertaking, we have a word to
offer in self-justification. We have no objection
to originality of the right stamp.
An originality which cherishes its own little
idiosyncrasies we despise. If we must
differ from other people, let us differ in
having a wide cosmopolitan culture. “All
men are alike in possessing defects,” says
Goethe; “in excellencies alone, it is, that
great differences may be found.”</p>

<p class='c006'>What philosophic originality may be, we
hope to show by the following consideration:</p>

<p class='c006'>It is the province of Philosophy to dissolve
and make clear to itself the entire
phenomena of the world. These phenomena
consist of two kinds: <i>first</i>, the products
of nature, or immediate existence;
<i>second</i>, the products of spirit, including
what modifications man has wrought upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the former, and his independent creations.
These spiritual products may be again
subdivided into <i>practical</i> (in which the
<i>will</i> predominates)—the institutions of
civilization—and <i>theoretical</i> (in which
the <i>intellect</i> predominates)—art, religion,
science, &amp;c. Not only must Philosophy
explain the immediate phenomena of nature—it
must also explain the mediate
phenomena of spirit. And not only are the
institutions of civilization proper objects
of study, but still more is this theoretic
side that which demands the highest activity
of the philosopher.</p>

<p class='c006'>To examine the thoughts of man—to unravel
them and make them clear—must
constitute the earliest employment of the
speculative thinker; his first business is to
comprehend the thought of the world; to
dissolve for himself the solutions which
have dissolved the world before him.
Hence, the prevalent opinion that it is far
higher to be an “original investigator”
than to be engaged in studying the
thoughts of others, leaves out of view the
fact that the thoughts of other men are
just as much objective phenomena to the
individual philosopher as the ground he
walks on. They need explanation just as
much. If I can explain the thoughts of
the profoundest men of the world, and
make clear wherein they differed among
themselves and from the truth, certainly
I am more original than they were. For
is not “original” to be used in the sense of
<i>primariness</i>, of approximation to the absolute,
universal truth? He who varies from
the truth must be secondary, and owe his
deflections to somewhat alien to his being,
and therefore be himself subordinate
thereto. Only the Truth makes Free and
Original. How many people stand in the
way of their own originality! If an absolute
Science should be discovered by anybody,
we could all become absolutely original
by mastering it. So much as I have
mastered of science, I have dissolved into
me, and have not left it standing alien
and opposed to me, but it is now my own.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our course, then, in the practical endeavor
to elevate the tone of American thinking,
is plain: we must furnish convenient
access to the deepest thinkers of ancient
and modern times. To prepare translations
and commentary, together with original
exposition, is our object. Originality
will take care of itself. Once disciplined
in Speculative thought, the new growths of
our national life will furnish us objects
whose comprehension shall constitute
original philosophy without parallel.
Meanwhile it must be confessed that those
who set up this cry for originality are not
best employed. Their ideals are commonplace,
and their demand is too easily satisfied
with the mere whimsical, and they
do not readily enough distinguish therefrom
the excellent.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CONTENTS OF THE JOURNAL.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Thus far the articles of this journal
have given most prominence to art in its
various forms. The speculative content
of art is more readily seen than that of
any other form, for the reason that its
sensuous element allows a more genial exposition.
The critique of the Second Part
of Faust, by Rosencrantz, published in
this number, is an eminent example of the
effect which the study of Speculative Philosophy
has upon the analytical understanding.
Is not the professor of logic
able to follow the poet, and interpret the
products of his creative imagination? The
portion of Hegel’s Æsthetics, published in
this number, giving, as it does, the historical
groundwork of art, furnishes in a
genial form an outline of the Philosophy
of History. Doubtless the characteristics
of the Anglo-Saxon mind make it difficult
to see in art what it has for such nations
as the Italians and Germans; we have the
reflective intellect, and do not readily attain
the standpoint of the creative imagination.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>STYLE.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In order to secure against ambiguity, it
is sometimes necessary to make inelegant
repetitions, and, to give to a limiting clause
its proper degree of subordination, such
devices as parentheses, dashes, etc., have
to be used to such a degree as to disfigure
the page. Capitals and italics are also
used without stint to mark important
words. The adjective has frequently to be
used substantively, and, if rare, this use is
marked by commencing it with a capital.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are three styles, which correspond
to the three grades of intellectual culture.
The sensuous stage uses simple, categorical
sentences, and relates facts, while the
reflective stage uses hypothetical ones, and
marks relations between one fact and
another; it introduces antithesis. The
stage of the Reason uses the disjunctive
sentence, and makes an assertion exhaustive,
by comprehending in it a multitude
of interdependencies and exclusions. Thus
it happens that the style of a Hegel is very
difficult to master, and cannot be translated
adequately into the sensuous style,
although many have tried it. A person is
very apt to blame the style of a deep
thinker when he encounters him for the
first time. It requires an “expert swimmer”
to follow the discourse, but for no
other reason than that the mind has not
acquired the strength requisite to grasp in
one thought a wide extent of conceptions.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY. <br /> Vol. I. 1867. No. 3.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c014'>THE MONADOLOGY. <br /> [Translated from the French of <span class='sc'>Leibnitz</span>, by <span class='sc'>F. H. Hedge</span>.]</h3>

<p class='c010'>1. The Monad, of which we shall here
speak, is merely a simple substance entering
into those which are compound; simple,
that is to say, without parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. And there must be simple substances,
since there are compounds; for the compound
is only a collection or aggregate of
simples.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Where there are no parts, neither extension,
nor figure, nor divisibility is possible;
and these Monads are the veritable
Atoms of Nature—in one word, the Elements
of things.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. There is thus no danger of dissolution,
and there is no conceivable way in
which a simple substance can perish naturally.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. For the same reason, there is no way
in which a simple substance can begin
naturally, since it could not be formed by
composition.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Therefore we may say that the Monads
can neither begin nor end in any
other way than all at once; that is to
say, they cannot begin except by creation,
nor end except by annihilation; whereas
that which is compounded, begins and ends
by parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. There is also no intelligible way in
which a Monad can be altered or changed
in its interior by any other creature, since
it would be impossible to transpose anything
in it, or to conceive in it any internal
movement—any movement excited,
directed, augmented or diminished
within, such as may take place in compound
bodies, where there is change of
parts. The Monads have no windows
through which anything can enter or go
forth. It would be impossible for any accidents
to detach themselves and go forth
from the substances, as did formerly the
Sensible Species of the Schoolmen. Accordingly,
neither substance nor accident
can enter a Monad from without.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. Nevertheless Monads must have qualities—otherwise
they would not even be
entities; and if simple substances did not
differ in their qualities, there would be no
means by which we could become aware of
the changes of things, since all that is in
compound bodies is derived from simple
ingredients, and Monads, being without
qualities, would be indistinguishable one
from another, seeing also they do not differ
in quantity. Consequently, a <i>plenum</i>
being supposed, each place could in any
movement receive only the just equivalent
of what it had had before, and one state
of things would be indistinguishable from
another.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. Moreover, each Monad must differ
from every other, for there are never two
beings in nature perfectly alike, and in
which it is impossible to find an internal
difference, or one founded on some intrinsic
denomination.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. I take it for granted, furthermore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>that every created being is subject to
change—consequently the created Monad;
and likewise that this change is continual
in each.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. It follows, from what we have now
said, that the natural changes of Monads
proceed from an internal principle, since
no external cause can influence the interior.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. But, besides the principle of change,
there must also be a detail of changes,
embracing, so to speak, the specification
and the variety of the simple substances.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. This detail must involve multitude
in unity or in simplicity: for as all natural
changes proceed by degrees, something
changes and something remains, and consequently
there must be in the simple substance
a plurality of affections and relations,
although there are no parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. This shifting state, which involves
and represents multitude in unity, or in
the simple substance, is nothing else than
what we call Perception, which must be
carefully distinguished from <i>apperception</i>,
or consciousness, as will appear in the sequel.
Here it is that the Cartesians have
especially failed, making no account of
those perceptions of which we are not conscious.
It is this that has led them to
suppose that spirits are the only Monads,
and that there are no souls of brutes or
other Entelechies. It is owing to this that
they have vulgarly confounded protracted
torpor with actual death, and have fallen
in with the scholastic prejudice, which believes
in souls entirely separate. Hence,
also, ill affected minds have been confirmed
in the opinion that the soul is mortal.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. The action of the internal principle
which causes the change, or the passage
from one perception to another, may be
called Appetition. It is true, the desire
cannot always completely attain to every
perception to which it tends, but it always
attains to something thereof, and arrives
at new perceptions.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. We experience in ourselves the fact
of multitude in the simple substance, when
we find that the least thought of which we
are conscious includes a variety in its object.
Accordingly, all who admit that the
soul is a simple substance, are bound to
admit this multitude in the Monad, and
Mr. Boyle should not have found any difficulty
in this admission, as he has done in
his dictionary—Art. Rorarius.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. Besides, it must be confessed that
Perception and its consequences are inexplicable
by mechanical causes—that is to
say, by figures and motions. If we imagine
a machine so constructed as to produce
thought, sensation, perception, we
may conceive it magnified—the same proportions
being preserved—to such an extent
that one might enter it like a mill.
This being supposed, we should find in it on
inspection only pieces which impel each
other, but nothing which can explain a
perception. It is in the simple substance,
therefore—not in the compound, or in
machinery—that we must look for that
phenomenon; and in the simple substance
we find nothing else—nothing, that is, but
perceptions and their changes. Therein
also, and therein only, consist all the internal
acts of simple substances.</p>

<p class='c006'>18. We might give the name of Entelechies
to all simple substances or created
Monads, inasmuch as there is in them a
certain completeness (perfection), (ἔχουσι
τὸ ἔντελες). There is a sufficiency (αὐτάρκεια)
which makes them the sources of their own
internal actions, and, as it were, incorporeal
automata.</p>

<p class='c006'>19. If we choose to give the name of
soul to all that has perceptions and desires,
in the general sense which I have
just indicated, all simple substances or
created Monads may be called souls. But
as sentiment is something more than simple
perception, I am willing that the general
name of Monads and Entelechies shall
suffice for those simple substances which
have nothing but perceptions, and that the
term souls shall be confined to those whose
perceptions are more distinct, and accompanied
by memory.</p>

<p class='c006'>20. For we experience in ourselves a
state in which we remember nothing, and
have no distinct perception, as when we
are in a swoon or in a profound and
dreamless sleep. In this state the soul
does not differ sensibly from a simple
Monad; but since this state is not permanent,
and since the soul delivers herself
from it, she is something more.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>21. And it does not by any means follow,
in that case, that the simple substance
is without perception: that, indeed,
is impossible, for the reasons given above;
for it cannot perish, neither can it subsist
without affection of some kind, which is
nothing else than its perception. But
where there is a great number of minute
perceptions, and where nothing is distinct,
one is stunned, as when we turn round and
round in continual succession in the same
direction; whence arises a vertigo, which
may cause us to faint, and which prevents
us from distinguishing anything. And
possibly death may produce this state for
a time in animals.</p>

<p class='c006'>22. And as every present condition of a
simple substance is a natural consequence
of its antecedent condition, so its present
is big with its future.</p>

<p class='c006'>23. Then, as on awaking from a state of
stupor, we become conscious of our perceptions,
we must have had perceptions,
although unconscious of them, immediately
before awaking. For each perception
can have no other natural origin but
an antecedent perception, as every motion
must be derived from one which preceded
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>24. Thus it appears that if there were
no distinction—no relief, so to speak—no
enhanced flavor in our perceptions, we
should continue forever in a state of stupor;
and this is the condition of the naked
Monad.</p>

<p class='c006'>25. And so we see that nature has given
to animals enhanced perceptions, by the
care which she has taken to furnish them
with organs which collect many rays of
light and many undulations of air, increasing
their efficacy by their union.
There is something approaching to this in
odor, in taste, in touch, and perhaps in a
multitude of other senses of which we
have no knowledge. I shall presently explain
how that which passes in the soul
represents that which takes place in the
organs.</p>

<p class='c006'>26. Memory gives to the soul a kind of
consecutive action which imitates reason,
but must be distinguished from it. We
observe that animals, having a perception
of something which strikes them, and of
which they have previously had a similar
perception, expect, through the representation
of their memory, the recurrence of
that which was associated with it in their
previous perception, and incline to the
same feelings which they then had. For
example, when we show dogs the cane,
they remember the pain which it caused
them, and whine and run.</p>

<p class='c006'>27. And the lively imagination, which
strikes and excites them, arises from the
magnitude or the multitude of their previous
perceptions. For often a powerful
impression produces suddenly the effect of
long habit, or of moderate perceptions
often repeated.</p>

<p class='c006'>28. In men as in brutes, the consecutiveness
of their perceptions is due to the
principle of memory—like empirics in
medicine, who have only practice without
theory. And we are mere empirics in
three-fourths of our acts. For example,
when we expect that the sun will rise to-morrow,
we judge so empirically, because
it has always risen hitherto. Only the astronomer
judges by an act of reason.</p>

<p class='c006'>29. But the cognition of necessary and
eternal truths is that which distinguishes
us from mere animals. It is this which
gives us Reason and Science, and raises
us to the knowledge of ourselves and of
God; and it is this in us which we call a
reasonable soul or spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>30. It is also by the cognition of necessary
truths, and by their abstractions, that
we rise to acts of reflection, which give us
the idea of that which calls itself “I,”
and which lead us to consider that this or
that is in us. And thus, while thinking of
ourselves, we think of Being, of substance,
simple or compound, of the immaterial,
and of God himself. We conceive that
that which in us is limited, is in him without
limit. And these reflective acts furnish
the principal objects of our reasonings.</p>

<p class='c006'>31. Our reasonings are founded on two
great principles, that of “<i>Contradiction</i>,”
by virtue of which we judge that to be
false which involves contradiction, and
that to be true which is opposed to, or
which contradicts the false.</p>

<p class='c006'>32. And that of the “<i>Sufficient Reason</i>,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>by virtue of which we judge that no fact
can be real or existent, no statement true,
unless there be a sufficient reason why it is
thus, and not otherwise, although these
reasons very often cannot be known to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>33. There are also two sorts of truths—those
of reasoning and those of fact.
Truths of reasoning are necessary, and
their opposite is impossible; those of fact
are contingent, and their opposite is possible.
When a truth is necessary, we may
discover the reason of it by analysis, resolving
it into simpler ideas and truths,
until we arrive at those which are ultimate.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>34. It is thus that mathematicians by
analysis reduce speculative theorems and
practical canons to definitions, axioms and
postulates.</p>

<p class='c006'>35. And finally, there are simple ideas
of which no definition can be given; there
are also axioms and postulates,—in one
word, <i>ultimate principles</i>, which cannot
and need not be proved. And these are
“Identical Propositions,” of which the opposite
contains an express contradiction.</p>

<p class='c006'>36. But there must also be a sufficient
reason for truths contingent, or truths of
fact—that is, for the series of things diffused
through the universe of creatures—or
else the process of resolving into particular
reasons might run into a detail without
bounds, on account of the immense
variety of the things of nature, and of the
infinite division of bodies. There is an
infinity of figures and of movements, present
and past, which enter into the efficient
cause of my present writing; and there is
an infinity of minute inclinations and dispositions
of my soul, present and past,
which enter into the final cause of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>37. And as all this detail only involves
other anterior or more detailed contingencies,
each one of which again requires a
similar analysis in order to account for it,
we have made no advance, and the sufficient
or final reason must be outside of
the series of this detail of contingencies,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
endless as it may be.</p>

<p class='c006'>38. And thus the final reason of things
must be found in a necessary Substance, in
which the detail of changes exists eminently
as their source. And this is that
which we call <span class='sc'>God</span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>39. Now this Substance being a sufficient
reason of all this detail, which also is everywhere
linked together, <i>there is but one
God, and this God suffices</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>40. We may also conclude that this supreme
Substance, which is Only,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Universal,
and Necessary—having nothing outside
of it which is independent of it, and
being a simple series of possible beings—must
be incapable of limits, and must contain
as much of reality as is possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>41. Whence it follows that God is
perfect, perfection being nothing but
the magnitude of positive reality taken
exactly, setting aside the limits or bounds
in that which is limited. And there, where
there are no bounds, that is to say, in God,
perfection is absolutely infinite.</p>

<p class='c006'>42. It follows also that the creatures
have their perfections from the influence
of God, but they have their imperfections
from their proper nature, incapable of existing
without bounds; for it is by this
that they are distinguished from God.</p>

<p class='c006'>43. It is true, moreover, that God is not
only the source of existences, but also of
essences, so far as real, or of that which
is real in the possible; because the divine
understanding is the region of eternal
truths, or of the ideas on which they depend,
and without Him there would be
nothing real in the possibilities, and not
only nothing existing, but also nothing
possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>44. At the same time, if there be a reality
in the essences or possibilities, or in
the eternal truths, this reality must be
founded in something existing and actual,
consequently in the existence of the necessary
Being, in whom essence includes
existence, or with whom it is sufficient to
be possible in order to be actual.</p>

<p class='c006'>45. Thus God alone (or the necessary
Being) possesses this privilege, that he
must exist if possible; and since nothing
can hinder the possibility of that which
includes no bounds, no negation, and consequently
no contradiction, that alone is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>sufficient to establish the existence of
God <i>a priori</i>. We have likewise proved it
by the reality of eternal truths. But we
have also just proved it <i>a posteriori</i> by
showing that, since contingent beings exist,
they can have their ultimate and sufficient
reason only in some necessary Being, who
contains the reason of his existence in
himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>46. Nevertheless, we must not suppose,
with some, that eternal verities, being dependent
upon God, are arbitrary, and depend
upon his will, as Des Cartes, and
afterward M. Poiret, appear to have conceived.
This is true only of contingent
truths, the principle of which is fitness, or
the choice of the best; whereas necessary
truths depend solely on His understanding,
and are its internal object.</p>

<p class='c006'>47. Thus God alone is the primitive
Unity, or the simple original substance of
which all the created or derived Monads
are the products; and they are generated,
so to speak, by continual fulgurations of
the Divinity, from moment to moment,
bounded by the receptivity of the creature,
of whose existence limitation is an essential
condition.</p>

<p class='c006'>48. In God is <i>Power</i>, which is the
source of all; then Knowledge, which
contains the detail of Ideas; and, finally,
Will, which generates changes or products
according to the principle of optimism.
And this answers to what, in created
Monads, constitutes the subject or the
basis, the perceptive and the appetitive
faculty. But in God these attributes are
absolutely infinite or perfect, and in the
created Monads, or in the Entelechies (or
<i>perfectihabiis</i>, as Hermolaus Barbarus
translates this word), they are only imitations
according to the measure of their
perfection.</p>

<p class='c006'>49. The creature is said to act externally,
in so far as it possesses perfection,
and to suffer from another (creature) so
far as it is imperfect. So we ascribe action
to the Monad, so far as it has distinct
perceptions, and passion, so far as its perceptions
are confused.</p>

<p class='c006'>50. And one creature is more perfect
than another, in this: that we find in it
that which serves to account <i>a priori</i> for
what passes in the other; and it is therefore
said to act upon the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>51. But in simple substances this is
merely an ideal influence of one Monad
upon another, which can pass into effect
only by the intervention of God, inasmuch
as in the ideas of God one Monad
has a right to demand that God, in regulating
the rest from the commencement of
things, shall have regard to it; for since
a created Monad can have no physical influence
on the interior of another, it is
only by this means that one can be dependent
on another.</p>

<p class='c006'>52. And hence it is that actions and
passions in creatures are mutual; for God,
comparing two simple substances, finds
reasons in each which oblige him to accommodate
the one to the other. Consequently
that which is active in one view,
is passive in another—active so far as
what we clearly discern in it serves to account
for that which takes place in another,
and passive so far as the reason of
that which passes in it is found in that
which is clearly discerned in another.</p>

<p class='c006'>53. Now, as in the ideas of God there is
an infinity of possible worlds, and as only
one can exist, there must be a sufficient
reason for the choice of God, which determines
him to one rather than another.</p>

<p class='c006'>54. And this reason can be no other
than fitness, derived from the different degrees
of perfection which these worlds
contain, each possible world having a
claim to exist according to the measure of
perfection which it enfolds.</p>

<p class='c006'>55. And this is the cause of the existence
of that Best, which the wisdom of
God discerns, which his goodness chooses,
and his power effects.</p>

<p class='c006'>56. And this connection, or this accommodation
of all created things to each,
and of each to all, implies in each simple
substance relations which express all the
rest. Each, accordingly, is a living and
perpetual mirror of the universe.</p>

<p class='c006'>57. And as the same city viewed from
different sides appears quite different, and
is perspectively multiplied, so, in the infinite
multitude of simple substances,
there are given, as it were, so many different
worlds which yet are only the perspectives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>of a single one, according to the
different points of view of each Monad.</p>

<p class='c006'>58. And this is the way to obtain the
greatest possible variety with the greatest
possible order—that is to say, the way to
obtain the greatest possible perfection.</p>

<p class='c006'>59. Thus this hypothesis (which I may
venture to pronounce demonstrated) is the
only one which properly exhibits the greatness
of God. And this Mr. Boyle acknowledges,
when in his dictionary (Art. Rorarius)
he objects to it. He is even disposed
to think that I attribute too much to God,
that I ascribe to him impossibilities; but
he can allege no reason for the impossibility
of this universal harmony, by which
each substance expresses exactly the perfections
of all the rest through its relations
with them.</p>

<p class='c006'>60. We see, moreover, in that which I
have just stated, the <i>a priori</i> reasons why
things could not be other than they are.
God, in ordering the whole, has respect to
each part, and specifically to each Monad,
whose nature being representative, is by
nothing restrained from representing the
whole of things, although, it is true, this
representation must needs be confused, as
it regards the detail of the universe, and
can be distinct only in relation to a small
part of things, that is, in relation to those
which are nearest, or whose relations to
any given Monad are greatest. Otherwise
each Monad would be a divinity. The
Monads are limited, not in the object, but
in the mode of their knowledge of the
object. They all tend confusedly to the
infinite, to the whole; but they are limited
and distinguished by the degrees of distinctness
in their perceptions.</p>

<p class='c006'>61. And compounds symbolize in this
with simples. For since the world is a
<i>plenum</i>, and all matter connected, and as
in a <i>plenum</i> every movement has some effect
on distant bodies, in proportion to
their distance, so that each body is affected
not only by those in actual contact with it,
and feels in some way all that happens to
them, but also through their means is affected
by others in contact with those by
which it is immediately touched—it follows
that this communication extends to
any distance. Consequently, each body
feels all that passes in the universe, so
that he who sees all, may read in each that
which passes everywhere else, and even
that which has been and shall be, discerning
in the present that which is removed
in time as well as in space. “Συμπνόιει
Πάντα,” says Hippocrates. But each soul
can read in itself only that which is distinctly
represented in it. It cannot unfold
its laws at once, for they reach into the
infinite.</p>

<p class='c006'>62. Thus, though every created Monad
represents the entire universe, it represents
more distinctly the particular body
to which it belongs, and whose Entelechy
it is: and as this body expresses the entire
universe, through the connection of
all matter in a <i>plenum</i>, the soul represents
also the entire universe in representing
that body which especially belongs to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>63. The body belonging to a Monad,
which is its Entelechy or soul, constitutes,
with its Entelechy, what may be termed a
living (thing), and, with its soul, what
may be called an animal. And the body
of a living being, or of an animal, is always
organic; for every Monad, being a
mirror of the universe, according to its
fashion, and the universe being arranged
with perfect order, there must be
the same order in the representative—that
is, in the perceptions of the soul, and consequently
of the body according to which
the universe is represented in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>64. Thus each organic living body is a
species of divine machine, or a natural
automaton, infinitely surpassing all artificial
automata. A machine made by human art
is not a machine in all its parts. For example,
the tooth of a brass wheel has parts
or fragments which are not artificial to us;
they have nothing which marks the machine
in their relation to the use for which
the wheel is designed; but natural machines—that
is, living bodies—are still
machines in their minutest parts, <i>ad infinitum</i>.
This makes the difference between
nature and art, that is to say, between the
Divine art and ours.</p>

<p class='c006'>65. And the author of nature was able
to exercise this divine and infinitely wonderful
art, inasmuch as every portion of
nature is not only infinitely divisible, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>the ancients knew, but is actually subdivided
without end—each part into parts,
of which each has its own movement.
Otherwise, it would be impossible that
each portion of matter should express the
universe.</p>

<p class='c006'>66. Whence it appears that there is a
world of creatures, of living (things), of
animals, of Entelechies, of souls, in the
minutest portion of matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>67. Every particle of matter may be conceived
as a garden of plants, or as a pond
full of fishes. But each branch of each
plant, each member of each animal, each
drop of their humors, is in turn another
such garden or pond.</p>

<p class='c006'>68. And although the earth and the air
embraced between the plants in the garden,
or the water between the fishes of the
pond, are not themselves plant or fish,
they nevertheless contain such, but mostly
too minute for our perception.</p>

<p class='c006'>69. So there is no uncultured spot, no
barrenness, no death in the universe—no
chaos, no confusion, except in appearance,
as it might seem in a pond at a distance,
in which one should see a confused motion
and swarming, so to speak, of the
fishes of the pond, without distinguishing
the fishes themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>70. We see, then, that each living body
has a governing Entelechy, which in animals
is the soul of the animal. But the
members of this living body are full of
other living bodies—plants, animals—each
of which has its Entelechy, or regent
soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>71. We must not, however, suppose—as
some who misapprehended my thought
have done—that each soul has a mass or
portion of matter proper to itself, or forever
united to it, and that it consequently
possesses other inferior living existences,
destined forever to its service. For all
bodies are in a perpetual flux, like rivers.
Their particles are continually coming and
going.</p>

<p class='c006'>72. Thus the soul does not change its
body except by degrees. It is never deprived
at once of all its organs. There are often
metamorphoses in animals, but never Metempsychosis—no
transmigration of souls.
Neither are there souls entirely separated
(from bodies), nor genii without bodies.
God alone is wholly without body.</p>

<p class='c006'>73. For which reason, also, there is
never complete generation nor perfect
death—strictly considered—consisting in
the separation of the soul. That which we
call generation, is development and accretion;
and that which we call death, is envelopment
and diminution.</p>

<p class='c006'>74. Philosophers have been much troubled
about the origin of forms, of Entelechies,
or souls. But at the present day,
when, by accurate investigations of plants,
insects and animals, they have become
aware that the organic bodies of nature
are never produced from chaos or from putrefaction,
but always from seed, in which
undoubtedly there had been a <i>preformation</i>;
it has been inferred that not only
the organic body existed in that seed before
conception, but also a soul in that
body—in one word, the animal itself—and
that, by the act of conception, this animal
is merely disposed to a grand transformation,
to become an animal of another species.
We even see something approaching
this, outside of generation, as when worms
become flies, or when caterpillars become
butterflies.</p>

<p class='c006'>75. Those animals, of which some are
advanced to a higher grade, by means of
conception, may be called <i>spermatic</i>; but
those among them which remain in their
kind—that is to say, the greater portion—are
born, multiply, and are destroyed, like
the larger animals, and only a small number
of the elect among them, pass to a
grander theatre.</p>

<p class='c006'>76. But this is only half the truth. I
have concluded that if the animal does not
begin to be in the order of nature, it also
does not cease to be in the order of nature,
and that not only there is no generation,
but no entire destruction—no death, strictly
considered. And these <i>a posteriori</i> conclusions,
drawn from experience, accord
perfectly with my principles deduced <i>a priori</i>,
as stated above.</p>

<p class='c006'>77. Thus we may say, not only that the
soul (mirror of an indestructible universe)
is indestructible, but also the animal itself,
although its machine may often perish in
part, and put off or put on organic spoils.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>78. These principles have furnished me
with a natural explanation of the union,
or rather the conformity between the soul
and the organized body. The soul follows
its proper laws, and the body likewise follows
those which are proper to it, and they
meet in virtue of the preëstablished harmony
which exists between all substances,
as representations of one and the same
universe.</p>

<p class='c006'>79. Souls act according to the laws of
final causes, by appetitions, means and
ends; bodies act according to the laws of
efficient causes, or the laws of motion.
And the two kingdoms, that of efficient
causes and that of final causes, harmonize
with each other.</p>

<p class='c006'>80. Des Cartes perceived that souls communicate
no force to bodies, because the
quantity of force in matter is always the
same. Nevertheless, he believed that souls
might change the direction of bodies. But
this was because the world was at that
time ignorant of the law of nature, which
requires the conservation of the same total
direction in matter. Had he known this,
he would have hit upon my system of preëstablished
harmony.</p>

<p class='c006'>81. According to this system, bodies act
as if there were no souls, and souls act as
if there were no bodies; and yet both act
as though the one influenced the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>82. As to spirits, or rational souls, although
I find that at bottom the same
principle which I have stated—namely,
that animals and souls begin with the
world and end only with the world—holds
with regard to all animals and living
things, yet there is this peculiarity in rational
animals, that although their spermatic
animalcules, as such, have only
ordinary or sensitive souls, yet as soon as
those of them which are <i>elected</i>, so to
speak, arrive by the act of conception at
human nature, their sensitive souls are
elevated to the rank of reason and to the
prerogative of spirits.</p>

<p class='c006'>83. Among other differences which distinguish
spirits from ordinary souls, some
of which have already been indicated,
there is also this: that souls in general
are living mirrors, or images of the universe
of creatures, but spirits are, furthermore,
images of Divinity itself, or of the
Author of Nature, capable of cognizing
the system of the universe, and of imitating
something of it by architectonic experiments,
each spirit being, as it were, a
little divinity in its own department.</p>

<p class='c006'>84. Hence spirits are able to enter into
a kind of fellowship with God. In their
view he is not merely what an inventor is
to his machine (as God is in relation to
other creatures), but also what a prince is
to his subjects, and even what a father is
to his children.</p>

<p class='c006'>85. Whence it is easy to conclude that
the assembly of all spirits must constitute
the City of God—that is to say, the most
perfect state possible, under the most perfect
of monarchs.</p>

<p class='c006'>86. This City of God, this truly universal
monarchy, is a moral world within the
natural; and it is the most exalted and the
most divine among the works of God. It
is in this that the glory of God most truly
consists, which glory would be wanting if
his greatness and his goodness were not
recognized and admired by spirits. It is
in relation to this Divine City that he possesses,
properly speaking, the attribute of
<i>goodness</i>, whereas his wisdom and his
power are everywhere manifest.</p>

<p class='c006'>87. As we have established above, a perfect
harmony between the two natural
kingdoms—the one of efficient causes, the
other of final causes—so it behooves us to
notice here also a still further harmony
between the physical kingdom of nature
and the moral kingdom of grace—that is
to say, between God considered as the
architect of the machine of the universe,
and God considered as monarch of the
divine City of Spirits.</p>

<p class='c006'>88. This harmony makes all things conduce
to grace by natural methods. This
globe, for example, must be destroyed and
repaired by natural means, at such seasons
as the government of spirits may require,
for the chastisement of some and
the recompense of others.</p>

<p class='c006'>89. We may say, furthermore, that God
as architect contains entirely God as legislator,
and that accordingly sins must carry
their punishment with them in the order
of nature, by virtue even of the mechanical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>structure of things, and that good
deeds in like manner will bring their recompense,
through their connection with

not always to, take place on the spot.</p>

<p class='c006'>90. Finally, under this perfect government,
there will be no good deed without
its recompense, and no evil deed without
its punishment, and all must redound to
the advantage of the good—that is to say,
of those who are not malcontents—in this
great commonwealth, who confide in Providence
after having done their duty, and
who worthily love and imitate the Author
of all good, pleasing themselves with the
contemplation of his perfections, following
the nature of pure and genuine Love,
which makes us blest in the happiness of
the loved. In this spirit, the wise and
good labor for that which appears to be
conformed to the divine will, presumptive
or antecedent, contented the while with all
that God brings to pass by his secret will,
consequent and decisive,—knowing that if
we were sufficiently acquainted with the
order of the universe we should find that
it surpasses all the wishes of the wisest,
and that it could not be made better than
it is, not only for all in general, but for
ourselves in particular, if we are attached,
as is fitting, to the Author of All, not only
as the architect and efficient cause of our
being, but also as our master and the final
cause, who should be the whole aim of
our volition, and who alone can make us
blest.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>A CRITICISM OF PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS. <br /> [Translated from the German of <span class='sc'>J. G. Fichte</span>, by <span class='sc'>A. E. Kroeger</span>.]</h3>
<p class='c009'>[<span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The following completes Fichte’s Second Introduction to the Science of Knowledge,
or his Criticism of Philosophical Systems. In the first division of what follows, Fichte
traces out his own transcendental standpoint in the Kantian Philosophy, and next proceeds, in
the second division, to connect it with what was printed in our previous number, criticising
without mercy the dogmatic standpoint. By the completion of this article, we have given to
the readers of our <i>Journal</i> Fichte’s own great Introductions to that Science of Knowledge,
which is about to be made accessible to American readers through the publishing house of
Messrs. Lippincott &amp; Co., Philadelphia. Our readers are, therefore, especially prepared to enter
upon a study of Fichte’s wonderful system, for none of these Introductions, as indeed none of
Fichte’s works of Science, have ever before been published in the English language. In a subsequent
number we shall print Fichte’s “Sun-clear Statement regarding the true nature of the
Science of Knowledge,” a masterly exhibition of the treatment of scientific subjects in a popular
form. We hope that all who have read, or will read these articles, will also enter upon a
study of the great work which they are designed to prepare for; the study is worth the pains.—<span class='sc'>Editor.</span>]</p>
<h4 class='c012'>I.</h4>
<p class='c005'>It is not the habit of the <i>Science of
Knowledge</i>, nor of its author, to seek protection
under any authority whatever. The
person who has first to see whether this
doctrine agrees with the doctrine of somebody
else before he is willing to be convinced
by it, is not one whom this science
calculates to convince, because the absolute
self-activity and independent faith in
himself which this science presupposes, is
wanting in him.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was therefore quite a different motive
than a desire to recommend his doctrines,
which led the author of the Science of
Knowledge to state that his doctrine was
in perfect harmony with Kant’s doctrine,
and was indeed the very same. In this
opinion he has been confirmed by the continued
elaboration of his system, which he
was compelled to undertake. Nevertheless,
all others who pass for students of
Kant’s philosophy, and who have spoken
on the subject—whether they were friends
or opponents of the Science of Knowledge—have
unanimously asserted the contrary;
and <i>by their advice</i>, even Kant himself,
who ought certainly best to understand
himself, asserts the contrary. If the author
of the Science of Knowledge were
disposed towards a certain manner of
thinking, this would be welcome news to
him. Moreover, since he considers it no
disgrace to have misunderstood Kant, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>foresees that to have misunderstood him
will soon be considered no disgrace by general
opinion, he ought surely not to hesitate
to assume that disgrace, especially as
it would confer upon him the honor of being
the first discoverer of a philosophy
which will certainly become universal, and
be productive of the most beneficial results
for mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is indeed scarcely explicable why
friends and opponents of the Science of
Knowledge so zealously contradict that assertion
of its author, and why they so
earnestly request him to prove it, although
he never promised to do so, nay, expressly
refused, since such a proof would rather
belong to a future History of Philosophy
than to a present representation of that
system. The opponents of the Science of
Knowledge in thus calling for a proof, are
certainly not impelled by a tender regard
for the fame of the author of that Science;
and the friends of it might surely leave the
subject alone, as I myself have no taste
for such an honor, and seek the only honor
which I know, in quite a different direction.
Do they clamor for this proof in order to
escape my charge, that they did not understand
the writings of Kant? But such an
accusation from the lips of the author of
the Science of Knowledge is surely no reproach,
since he confesses as loudly as possible,
that he also has not understood them,
and that only after he had discovered in
his own way the Science of Knowledge,
did he find a correct and harmonious interpretation
of Kant’s writings. Indeed, that
charge will soon cease to be a reproach
from the lips of anybody. But perhaps
this clamor is raised to escape the charge
that they did not recognize their own doctrine,
so zealously defended by them, when
it was placed before them in a different
shape from their own. If this is the case,
I should like to save them this reproach
also, if there were not another interest,
which to me appears higher than theirs,
and to which their interest <i>shall</i> be sacrificed.
The fact is, I do not wish to be considered
for one moment more than I am,
nor to ascribe to myself a merit which I
do not possess.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall therefore, in all probability, be
compelled to enter upon the proof which
they so earnestly demand, and hence improve
the opportunity at present offered
to me.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Science of Knowledge starts, as we
have just now seen, from an intellectual
contemplation, from the absolute self-activity
of the Ego.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it would seem beyond a doubt, and
evident to all the readers of Kant’s writings,
that this man has declared himself
on no subject more decisively, nay, I might
say contemptuously, than in denying this
power of an intellectual contemplation.
This denial seems so thoroughly rooted in
the Kantian System, that, after all the
elaboration of his philosophy, which he
has undertaken <i>since</i><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> the appearance of
the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, and by means
of which, as will be evident to any one,
the propositions of that first work have received
a far higher clearness and development
than they originally possessed;—he
yet, in one of his latest works, feels constrained
to repeat those assertions with
undiminished energy, and to show that the
present style of philosophy, which treats
all labor and exertion with contempt, as
well as a most disastrous fanaticism, have
resulted from the phantom of an intellectual
contemplation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Is any further proof needed, that a Philosophy,
which is based on the very thing
so decidedly rejected by the Kantian System,
must be precisely the opposite of that
system, and must be moreover the very
senseless and disastrous system, of which
Kant speaks in that work of his? Perhaps,
however, it might be well first to inquire,
whether the same word may not express
two utterly different conceptions in
the two systems. In Kant’s terminology,
all contemplation is directed upon a <i>Being</i>
(a permanent Remaining); and intellectual
contemplation would thus signify in his
system the immediate consciousness of a
non-sensuous Being, or the immediate consciousness
(through pure thinking) of the
thing per se; and hence a creation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>thing <i>per se</i> through its conception, in
nearly the same manner as the existence
of God is demonstrated from the mere
conception of God;—those who do so must
look upon God’s existence as a mere sequence
of their thinking. Now Kant’s
system—taking the direction it did take—may
have considered it necessary in this
manner to keep the thing <i>per se</i> at a respectful
distance. But the Science of
Knowledge has finished the thing <i>per se</i> in
another manner; that Science knows it to
be the completest perversion of reason, a
purely irrational conception. To that
science all being is necessarily <i>sensuous</i>,
for it evolves the very conception of Being
from the form of sensuousness. That
science regards the intellectual contemplation
of Kant’s system as a phantasm, which
vanishes the moment one attempts to think
it, and which indeed is not worth a name
at all. The intellectual contemplation,
whereof the Science of Knowledge speaks,
is not at all directed upon a Being, but
upon an Activity; and Kant does not even
designate it, (unless you wish to take the
expression “<i>Pure apperception</i>” for such
a designation). Nevertheless, it can be
clearly shown where in Kant’s System it
ought to have been mentioned. I hope
that the <i>categorical imperative</i> of Kant
occurs in consciousness, according to his
System. Now what sort of consciousness
is this of the categorical imperative? This
question Kant never proposed to himself,
because he never treated of the basis of <i>all</i>
Philosophy. In his <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>
he treated only of theoretical Philosophy,
and could therefore not introduce the
categorical imperative; in his <i>Critique of
Practical Reason</i>, he treated only of practical
Philosophy, wherein the question concerning
the manner of consciousness could
not arise.</p>

<p class='c006'>This consciousness is doubtless an immediate,
but no sensuous consciousness—hence
exactly what I call intellectual contemplation.
Now, since we have no classical
author in Philosophy, I give it the
latter name, with the same right with
which Kant gives it to something else,
which is a mere nothing; and with the
same right I insist that people ought first to
become acquainted with the significance of
my terminology before proceeding to judge
my system.</p>

<p class='c006'>My most estimable friend, the Rev. Mr.
Schulz—to whom I had made known my
indefinite idea of building up the whole
Science of Philosophy on the pure Ego,
long before I had thoroughly digested that
idea, and whom I found less opposed to it
than any one else—has a remarkable passage
on this subject. In his review of
Kant’s <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, he says:
“The pure, active self-consciousness, in
which really every one’s Ego consists, must
not be confounded—for the very reason
because it can and must teach us in
an immediate manner—with the <i>power
of contemplation</i>, and must not be made to
involve the doctrine that we are in possession
of a <i>supersensuous, intellectual power
of contemplation</i>. For we call <i>contemplation</i>
a <i>representation</i>, which is <i>immediately</i>
related to an object. But pure self-consciousness
is not representation, but is
rather that which first makes a representation
to become really a representation.
If I say, ‘I represent something to myself,’
it signifies just the same as if I said, ‘I am
conscious that I have a representation of
this object.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>According to Mr. Schulz, therefore, a
representation is that whereof consciousness
is possible. Now Mr. Schulz also
speaks of pure self-consciousness. Undoubtedly
he knows whereof he speaks,
and hence, as philosopher, he most truly
has a representation of pure self-consciousness.
It was not of this consciousness
of the philosopher, however, that Mr.
Schulz spoke, but of original consciousness;
and hence the significance of his
assertion is this: Originally (i. e. in common
consciousness without philosophical
reflection) mere self-consciousness does
not constitute full consciousness, but is
merely a necessary compound, which
makes full consciousness first possible.
But is it not the same with <i>sensuous</i> contemplation?
Does <i>sensuous</i> contemplation
constitute a consciousness, or is it not
rather merely that whereby a representation
first becomes a representation? Contemplation
without conception is confessedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>blind. How, then, can Mr. Schulz
call (sensuous) contemplation (excluding
from it self-consciousness) representation?
From the standpoint of the philosopher,
as we have just seen, self-consciousness is
equally representation; from the standpoint
of original contemplation, sensuous
contemplation is equally <i>not</i> representation.
Or does the conception constitute a
representation? The conception without
contemplation is confessedly empty. In
truth, self-consciousness, sensuous contemplation,
and conception, are, in their
isolated separateness, not representations—they
are only that through which representations
become possible. According to
Kant, to Schulz, and to myself, a complete
representation contains a threefold:
1st. That whereby the representation relates
itself to an object, and becomes the
representative of a <i>Something</i>—and this
we unanimously call the <i>sensuous contemplation</i>
(even if I am myself the object of
my representation, it is by virtue of a sensuous
contemplation, for then I become to
myself a permanent in time); 2d. That
through which the representation relates
itself to the subject, and becomes <i>my</i> representation;
this I also call contemplation
(but <i>intellectual contemplation</i>), because
it has the same relation to the complete
representation which the sensuous
contemplation has; but Kant and Schulz
do not want it called so; and, 3d. That
through which both are united, and only
in this union become representation; and
this we again unanimously call <i>conception</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to state it tersely: what is really
the Science of Knowledge in two words?
It is this: Reason is absolutely self-determined;
Reason is only for Reason; but
for Reason there is also nothing but Reason.
Hence, everything, which Reason is,
must be grounded in itself, and out of itself,
but not in or out of another—some
external other, which it could never grasp
without giving up itself. In short, the
Science of Knowledge is transcendental
idealism. Again, what is the content of
the Kantian system in two words? I confess
that I cannot conceive it possible how
any one can understand even one sentence
of Kant, and harmonize it with others, except
on the same presupposition which the
Science of Knowledge has just asserted.
I believe that that presupposition is the
everlasting refrain of his system; and I
confess that one of the reasons why I refused
to prove the agreement of the
Science of Knowledge with Kant’s system
was this: It appeared to me somewhat too
ridiculous and too tedious to show up the
forest by pointing out the several trees in
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>I will cite here one chief passage from
Kant. He says: “The highest principle
of the possibility of all contemplation in
relation to the understanding is this: that
all the manifold be subject to the conditions
of the original unity of apperception.”
That is to say, in other words,
“That something which is contemplated
be also <i>thought</i>, is only possible on condition
that the possibility of the original
unity of apperception can coexist with it.”
Now since, according to Kant, contemplation
also is possible only on condition that
it be thought and comprehended—otherwise
it would remain blind—and since
contemplation itself is thus subject to the
conditions of the possibility of thinking—it
follows that, according to Kant, not
only Thinking immediately, but by the
mediation of thinking, contemplation also,
and hence <i>all consciousness</i>, is subject to
the conditions of the original unity of apperception.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, what is this condition? It is true,
Kant speaks of conditions, but he states
only one as a fundamental condition.
What is this condition of the original
unity of apperception? It is this (see § 16
of the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>), “that my
representations <i>can</i> be accompanied by the
‘<i>I</i> think’”—the word “<i>I</i>” alone is italicised
by Kant, and this is somewhat important;
that is to say, <i>I am the thinking</i> in
this thinking.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of what “I” does Kant speak here?
Perhaps of the Ego, which his followers
quietly heap together by a manifold of
representations, in no single one of which
it was, but in all of which collectively it
now is said to be. Then the words of
Kant would signify this: I, who think D,
am the same I who thought A, B and C,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and it is only through the thinking of my
manifold thinking, that I first became I to
myself—that is to say, the <i>identical</i> in the
manifold? In that case Kant would have
been just such a pitiable tattler as these
Kantians; for in that case the possibility
of all thinking would be conditioned, according
to him, by another thinking, and
by the thinking of this thinking; and I
should like to know how we could ever arrive
at a thinking.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, instead of tracing the consequences
of Kant’s statement, I merely intended to
cite his own words. He says again: “This
representation, ‘<i>I</i> think,’ is an act of spontaneity,
i. e. it cannot be considered as belonging
to ‘sensuousness’.“ (I add: and
hence, also, not to inner sensuousness, to
which the above described identity of consciousness
most certainly does belong.)
Kant continues: “I call it pure apperception,
in order to distinguish it from the
empirical (just described) apperception,
and because it is that self-consciousness,
which, in producing the representation ‘I
think’—which must accompany all other
representations, and is <i>in all consciousness
one and the same</i>—can itself be accompanied
by no other representation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the character of pure self-consciousness
is surely clearly enough described.
It is in all consciousness the
same—hence undeterminable by any accident
of consciousness; in it the Ego
is only determined through itself, and is
thus absolutely determined. It is also
clear here, that Kant could not have understood
this pure apperception to mean
the consciousness of our individuality, nor
could he have taken the latter for the
former; for the consciousness of my individuality,
as an <i>I</i>, is necessarily conditioned
by, and only possible through, the
consciousness of another individuality, a
<i>Thou</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence we discover in Kant’s writings
the conception of the <i>pure Ego</i> exactly as
the Science of Knowledge has described it,
and completely determined. Again, in
what relation does Kant, in the above passage,
place this pure Ego to all consciousness?
As <i>conditioning the same</i>. Hence,
according to Kant, the possibility of all
consciousness is conditioned by the possibility
of the pure Ego, or by pure self-consciousness,
just as the Science of Knowledge
holds. In thinking, the conditioning
is made the prior of the conditioned—for
this is the significance of that relation;
and thus it appears that, according to Kant,
a systematic deduction of all consciousness,
or, which is the same, a System of
Philosophy, must proceed from the pure
Ego, just as the Science of Knowledge
proceeds; and Kant himself has thus suggested
the idea of such a Science.</p>

<p class='c006'>But some one might wish to weaken this
argument by the following distinction: It
is one thing to <i>condition</i>, and another to
<i>determine</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to Kant, all consciousness is
only <i>conditioned</i> by self-consciousness;
i. e. the <i>content</i> of that consciousness may
have its ground in something else than
self-consciousness; provided the results of
that grounding do not <i>contradict</i> the conditions
of self-consciousness; those results
need not <i>proceed</i> from self-consciousness,
provided they do not cancel its possibility.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, according to the Science of Knowledge,
all consciousness is <i>determined</i>
through self-consciousness; i. e. everything
which occurs in consciousness is
<i>grounded</i>, <i>given</i> and <i>produced</i> by the conditions
of self-consciousness, and a ground
of the same in something other than self-consciousness
does not exist at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, to meet this argument, I must show
that in the present case the <i>determinateness</i>
follows immediately from the <i>conditionedness</i>,
and that, therefore, the distinction
drawn between both is not valid in this instance.
Whosoever says, “All consciousness
is conditioned by the possibility
of self-consciousness, <i>and as such I now
propose to consider it</i>,” knows in this his
investigation, nothing more concerning
consciousness, and abstracts from everything
he may believe, further to know
concerning it. He deduces what is required
from the asserted principle, and only what
he thus has <i>deduced</i> as consciousness is
for him consciousness, and everything else
is and remains nothing. Thus the derivability
from self-consciousness <i>determines</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>for him the extent of that which he holds
to be consciousness, because he starts from
the presupposition that all consciousness
is <i>conditioned</i> by the possibility of self-consciousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now I know very well that Kant has by
no means <i>built up</i> such a system; for if he
had, the author of the Science of Knowledge
would not have undertaken that work,
but would have chosen another branch of
human knowledge for his field. I know
that he has by no means <i>proven</i> his categories
to be conditions of self-consciousness;
I know that he has simply asserted
them so to be; that he has still less deduced
time and space, and that which in
original consciousness is <i>inseparable</i> from
them—the matter which fills time and space—as
such conditions; since of these he has
not even expressly stated, as he has done
in the case of the categories, that they are
such conditions. But I believe I know
quite as well that Kant has <i>thought</i> such
a system; that all his writings and utterances
are fragments and results of this
system, and that his assertions get meaning
and intention only through this presupposition.
Whether he did not himself think
this system with sufficient clearness and
definiteness to enable him to utter it for
others; or whether he did, indeed, think
it thus clearly and merely <i>did not want</i> so
to utter it, as some remarks would seem to
indicate, might, it seems to me, be left undecided;
at least somebody else must investigate
this matter, for I have never asserted
anything on this point.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> But, however
such an investigation may result, this
<i>merit</i> surely belongs altogether to the great
man; that he first of all consciously separated
philosophy from external objects,
and led that science into the Self. This is
the spirit and the inmost soul of all his
philosophy, and this also is the spirit and
soul of the Science of Knowledge.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am reminded of a chief distinction
which is said to exist between the Science
of Knowledge and Kant’s system, and a
distinction which but recently has been
again insisted upon by a man who is justly
supposed to have understood Kant, and
who has shown that he also has understood
the Science of Knowledge. This man is
Reinhold, who, in a late essay, in endeavoring
to prove that I have done injustice
to <i>myself</i>, and to other successful students
of Kant’s writings—in stating what I have
just now reiterated and proved, i. e. that
Kant’s system and the Science of Knowledge
are the same—proceeds to remark:
“The <i>ground</i> of our assertion, that there
is an external something corresponding to
our representations, is most certainly held
by the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> to be contained
in the Ego; but only in so far as <i>empirical
knowledge</i> (experience) has taken
place in the Ego as a fact; that is to say,
the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> holds that this
empirical knowledge has its ground in the
pure Ego only in relation to its <i>transcendental
content</i>, which is the <i>form</i> of that
knowledge; but in regard to its <i>empirical</i>
content, which gives that knowledge objective
validity, it is grounded in the Ego
through a something <i>which is not the Ego</i>.
Now, a scientific form of philosophy was
not possible so long as that something,
which is not Ego, was looked for outside
of the Ego as ground of the objective reality
of the transcendental content of the
Ego.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus Reinhold. I have not convinced
my readers, or demonstrated my proof,
until I have met this objection.</p>

<p class='c006'>The (purely historical) question is this:
Has Kant really placed the ground of experience
(in its empirical content) <i>in a
something different from the Ego</i>?</p>

<p class='c006'>I know very well that all the Kantians,
except Mr. Beck, whose work appeared
after the publication of the Science of
Knowledge, have really understood Kant
to say this. Nay, the last interpreter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Kant, Mr. Schulz, whom Kant himself has
endorsed, thus interprets him. How often
does Mr. Schulz admit that <i>the objective
ground of the appearances is contained in
something which is a thing in itself</i>, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. We have just seen how Reinhold also
interprets Kant.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it may seem presumptuous for one
man to arise and say: “Up to this moment,
amongst a number of worthy scholars who
have devoted their time and energies to
the interpretation of a certain book, not a
single one has understood that book otherwise
than <i>utterly falsely</i>; they all have discovered
in that system the very doctrine
which it refutes—dogmatism, instead of
transcendental idealism; <i>and I alone understand
it rightly</i>.” Yet this presumption
might be but seemingly so; for it is to be
hoped that other persons will adopt that
one man’s views, and that, therefore, he
will not always stand alone. There are
other reasons why it is not very presumptuous
to contradict the whole number of
Kantians, but I will not mention them
here.</p>

<p class='c006'>But what is most curious in this matter
is this—the discovery that Kant did not
intend to speak of a something different
from the Ego, is by no means a new one.
For ten years everybody could read the
most thorough and complete proof of it
in Jacobi’s “Idealism and Realism,” and
in his “Transcendental Idealism.” In
those works, Jacobi has put together the
most evident and decisive passages from
Kant’s writings on this subject, in Kant’s
own words. I do not like to do again
what has once been done, and cannot
be done better; and I refer my readers
with the more pleasure to those works, as
they, like all philosophical writings of
Jacobi, may be even yet of advantage to
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few questions, however, I propose to
address to those interpreters of Kant.
Tell me, how far does the applicability of
the categories extend, according to Kant,
particularly of the category of causality?
Clearly only to the field of appearances,
and hence only to that which is already
in us and for us. But in what manner do
we then come to accept a something different
from the Ego, as the ground of the
empirical content of Knowledge? I answer:
only by drawing a conclusion from
the grounded to the ground; hence by applying
the category of causality. Thus,
indeed, Kant himself discovers it to be,
and hence rejects the assumption of <i>things,
&amp;c., &amp;c., outside of us</i>. But his interpreters
make him forget for the present instance
the validity of categories generally,
and make him arrive, by a bold leap, from
the world of appearances to the thing <i>per
se</i> outside of us. Now, how do these interpreters
justify this inconsequence?</p>

<p class='c006'>Kant evidently speaks of a thing <i>per se</i>.
But what is this thing to him? A <i>noumenon</i>,
as we can find in many passages of his
writings. Reinhold and Schulz also hold
it to be a <i>noumenon</i>. Now, what is a <i>noumenon</i>?
According to Kant, to Reinhold,
and Schulz, a something, which our <i>thinking</i>—by
laws to be shown up, and which
Kant has shown up—<i>adds</i> to the appearance,
and which <i>must</i> so be added in
<i>thought</i>;<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> which, therefore, is produced
<i>only through our thinking</i>; not, however,
through our <i>free</i>, but through a <i>necessary</i>
thinking, which is only <i>for our thinking</i>—for
us thinking beings.</p>

<p class='c006'>But what do those interpreters make of
this <i>noumenon</i> or thing in itself? The
thought of this thing in itself is grounded
in sensation, and sensation they again
assert to be grounded in the thing in itself.
Their globe rests on the great elephant,
and the great elephant—rests on the globe.
Their thing in itself, which is a mere
thought, they say <i>affects</i> the Ego. Have
they then forgotten their first speech, and
is the thing, <i>per se</i>, which a moment ago
was but a mere thought, now turned into
something more? Or do they seriously
mean to apply to a mere thought, the exclusive
predicate of reality, i. e. causality?
And such teachings are put forth as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>astonishing discoveries of the great genius,
who, with his torch, lights up the retrograde
philosophical century.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is but too well known to me that the
Kantianism of the Kantians is precisely
the just described system—is really this
monstrous composition of the most vulgar
dogmatism, which allows things <i>per se</i> to
make impressions upon us, and of the most
decided idealism, which allows all being
to be generated only through the thinking
of the intelligence, and which knows nothing
of any other sort of being. From what
I am yet going to say on this subject, I
except two men—Reinhold, because with
a power of mind and a love of truth which
do credit to his heart and head, he has
abandoned this system, (which, however,
he still holds to be the Kantian system,
and I only disagree with him on this purely
historical question,) and Schulz, because
he has of late been silent on philosophical
questions, which leaves it fair to assume
that he has begun to doubt his former
system.</p>

<p class='c006'>But concerning the others, it must be
acknowledged by all who have still their
inner sense sufficiently under control to
be able to distinguish between being and
thinking and not to mix both together,
that a system which thus mixes being
and thinking receives but too much
honor if it is spoken of seriously. To be
sure, very few men may be properly required
to overcome the natural tendency
towards dogmatism sufficiently to lift
themselves up to the free flight of Speculation.
What was impossible for a man
of overwhelming mental activity like
Jacobi, how can it be expected of certain
other men, whom I would rather not name?
But that these incurable dogmatists should
have persuaded themselves that Kant’s
<i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> was food for them;
that they had the boldness to conclude—since
Kant’s writings had been praised
(God may know by what chance!) in some
celebrated journal—they might also now
follow the fashion and become Kantians;
that since then, for years, they, in their
intoxication, have be-written many a ream
of valuable paper, without ever, in all this
time, having come to their senses, or understood
but one period of all they have
written; that up to the present day,
though they have been somewhat rudely
shaken, they have not been able to rub the
sleep out of their eyes, but rather prefer
to beat and kick about them, in the hope
of striking some of these unwelcome disturbers
of their peace; and that the German
public, so desirous of acquiring
knowledge, should have bought their
blackened paper with avidity, and attempted
to suck up the spirit of it—nay,
should even, perhaps, have copied and recopied
these writings without ever clearly
perceiving that there was no sense in
them: all this will forever, in the annals
of philosophy, remain the disgrace of our
century, and our posterity will be able to
explain these occurrences of our times
only on the presupposition of a mental
epidemic, which had taken hold of this
age.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, will these interpreters reply: your
argument is, after all—if we abstract from
Jacobi’s writings, which, to be sure, are
rather hard to swallow, since they quote
Kant’s own words—no more than this: it
is absurd; hence Kant cannot have meant
to say it. Now, if we admit the absurdity,
as unfortunately we must, why, then,
might not Kant have said these absurdities,
just as well as we others, amongst
whom there are some, of whom you yourself
confess the merits, and to whom you
doubtless will not deny all sound understanding?</p>

<p class='c006'>I reply: to be the inventor of a system is
one thing, and to be his commentators and
successors, another. What, in case of the
latter, would not testify to an absolute want
of sound sense, might certainly evince it in
the former. The ground is this: the latter
are not yet possessed of the idea of the
whole—for if they were so possessed, there
would be no necessity for them to study
the system; they are merely to construct
it out of the <i>parts</i> which the inventor
hands over to them; and all these parts
are, in their minds, not fully determined,
rounded off, and made smooth, until they
are united into a natural whole. Now,
this construction of the parts may require
some time, and during this time it may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>occur that these men determine some parts
inaccurately, and hence place them in contradiction
with the whole, of which they
are not yet possessed. The discoverer of
the idea of the whole, on the contrary,
proceeds from this idea, in which all parts
are united, and these parts he separately
places before his readers, because only
thus can he communicate the whole. The
work of the former is a synthetizing of
that which they do not yet possess, but are
to obtain through the synthesis; the work
of the latter is an analyzing of that which
he already possesses. It is very possible
that the former may not be aware of the
contradiction in which the several parts
stand to the whole which is to be composed
of them, for they may not have got
so far yet as to compare them. But it is
quite certain that the latter, who proceeded
from the composite, must have thought,
or believed that he thought, the contradiction
which is in the parts of his representation—for
<i>he</i> certainly at one time held all
the parts together. It is not absurd to
think dogmatism now, and in another moment
transcendental idealism; for this we
all do, and must do, if we wish to philosophize
about both systems; but it is absurd
to think both systems as <i>one</i>. The
interpreters of Kant’s system do not necessarily
think it thus as one; but the author
of that system must certainly have done
so if his system was intended to effect
such a union.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, I, at least, am utterly incapable of
believing such an absurdity on the part of
any one who has his senses; how, then,
can I believe Kant to have been guilty of
it? Unless Kant, therefore, declares expressly
in so many words, <i>that he deduces
sensation from an impression of the thing</i>,
<i>per se</i>, or, to use his own terminology, <i>that
sensation must be explained in philosophy,
from a transcendental object which exists
outside of us</i>, I shall not believe what
these interpreters tell us of Kant. But if
he does make this declaration, I shall consider
the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> rather as
the result of the most marvellous accident
than as the product of a mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, say our opponents, does not Kant
state expressly that “The object is given
to us,” and “that this is possible because
the object affects us as in a certain manner,”
and “that there is a power of attaining
representations by the manner in
which objects affect us, which power is
called <i>sensuousness</i>.” Nay, Kant says even
this: “How should our knowledge be
awakened into exercise if it were not done
by objects that touch our senses and
partly produce representations themselves,
while partly putting our power of understanding
into motion, to compare, connect
and separate these representations, and
thus to form the <i>raw material</i> of our sensuous
impressions into a knowledge which
is called experience.” Well, these are
probably all the passages which can be
adduced by our opponents. Now, putting
merely passages against passages, and
words against words, and abstracting altogether
from the idea of the whole,
which I assume these interpreters never to
have had, let me ask first, if these passages
could really not be united with Kant’s
other frequently repeated statements, viz.,
that it is folly to speak of an impression
produced upon us by an external transcendental
object,—how did it happen
that these interpreters preferred to sacrifice
the many statements, which assert a
transcendental idealism, to these <i>few</i> passages,
which assert a dogmatism, than
<i>vice versa</i>? Doubtless because they did
not attempt the study of Kant’s writings
with an impartial mind, but had their
heads full of that dogmatism—which constitutes
their very being—as the only correct
system, which they assumed such a
sensible man as Kant must necessarily
also hold to be the only correct system;
and because they thus did not seek to be
taught by Kant, but merely to be confirmed
by him in their old way of thinking.</p>

<p class='c006'>But cannot these seemingly opposite
statements be united? Kant speaks in
these passages of <i>objects</i>. What this word
is to signify, we clearly must learn from
Kant himself. He says: “It is the understanding
which adds the object to the
appearance, by <i>connecting</i> the manifold
of the appearance <i>in one consciousness</i>.
When this is done, we say we know the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span><i>object</i>, for we have effected a synthetical
unity in the manifold of the contemplation,
and the conception of this unity is
the representation of the object = X. <i>But
this</i> X <i>is not the transcendental object</i> (i. e.
the thing <i>per se</i>), <i>for of that we know not
even so much</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>What, then, is this object? That which
the understanding <i>adds</i> to the appearance,
<i>a mere thought</i>. Now, the object affects—i.
e. <i>something which is a mere thought
affects</i>. What does this mean? If I have
but a spark of logic, it means simply: it
affects in so far as it is; hence <i>it is only
thought as affecting</i>. Let us now see what
Kant means when he speaks about the
“power to obtain representations by the
manner in which objects affect us.” Since
we only <i>think</i> the affection itself, we
doubtless only think likewise that which is
common to the affection. Or: if you posit
an object with the thought that it has
affected you, you think yourself <i>in this
case affected</i>; and if you think that this
occurs in respect to <i>all</i> the objects of your
perception, you think yourself as <i>liable to
be affected generally</i>—or, in other words,
you ascribe to yourself, <i>through this your
thinking</i>, receptivity or sensuousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>But do we not thus assume, after all,
<i>affection</i> to explain knowledge? Let me
state the difference in one word: it is true,
all our knowledge proceeds from <i>an affection</i>,
but not an affection <i>through an object</i>.
This is Kant’s doctrine, and that of
the Science of Knowledge. As Mr. Beck
has overlooked this important point, and
as Reinhold does not call sufficient attention
to that which makes the positing of a
non-Ego possible, I consider it proper to
explain the matter in a few words. In
doing so I shall use my own terminology,
and not Kant’s, because I naturally have
my own more at my command.</p>

<p class='c006'>When I posit myself, I posit myself
as a limited; in consequence of the contemplation
of my self-positing, I am finite.</p>

<p class='c006'>This, my limitedness—since it is the
condition which makes my self-positing
possible—is an original limitedness.
Somebody might wish to explain this still
further, and either deduce the limitedness
of myself as the reflected, from my necessary
limitedness as the reflecting; which
would result in the statement: I am finite
to myself, because I can think only the
finite;—or he might explain the limitedness
of the reflecting from that of the reflected,
which would result in the statement:
I can think only the finite, because
I am finite. But such an explanation
would explain nothing, for I am originally
neither the reflecting nor the reflected, but
<i>both in their union</i>; which union I cannot
think, it is true, because I separate, in
thinking, the reflecting from the reflected.</p>

<p class='c006'>All limitedness is, by its very conception,
a <i>determined</i>, and not a general limitedness.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the possibility of an Ego, we have
thus deduced the necessity of a <i>general
limitedness</i> of the Ego. But the <i>determinedness</i>
of this limitedness cannot be deduced,
since it is, as we have seen, that
which conditions all Egoness. Here,
therefore, all deduction is at an end.
This <i>determinedness</i> appears as the absolutely
accidental, and furnishes the <i>merely
empirical</i> of our knowledge. It is this
determinedness, for instance, by virtue of
which I am, amongst all possible rational
beings, a <i>man</i>, and amongst all men this
<i>particular</i> person, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>This, my limitation, in its determinedness,
manifests itself as a limitation of
my practical power (here philosophy is
therefore driven from the theoretical to
the practical sphere); and the immediate
perception of this limitation is a <i>feeling</i> (I
prefer to use this word instead of Kant’s
“<i>sensation</i>,” for feeling only becomes
sensation by being related in thinking to
an object); for instance, the feeling of
sweet, red, cold, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>To forget this original feeling, leads to
a bottomless transcendental idealism, and
to an incomplete philosophy, which cannot
explain the simply sensible predicates of
objects. Now, the endeavor to explain
this original feeling from the causality of
a <i>something</i>, is the dogmatism of the Kantians,
which I have just shown up, and
which they would like to put on Kant’s
shoulders. This, their something, is the
everlasting thing <i>per se</i>. All <i>transcendental</i>
explanation, on the contrary, stops at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>the immediate feeling, from the reason
just pointed out. It is true, the <i>empirical</i>
Ego, which transcendental idealism observes,
explains this feeling to itself by
the law, “No limitation without a limiting;”
and thus, through contemplation of
the limiting, produces extended matter, of
which it now, as of its ground, predicates
the merely subjective sensation of feeling;
and it is only by virtue of this synthesis
that the Ego makes itself an object.
The continued analysis and the continued
explanation of its own condition, give to
the Ego its own system of a universe; and
the observation of the laws of this explanation
gives to the philosopher his science.
It is here that Kant’s <i>Realism</i> is based, but
his Realism is a <i>transcendental idealism</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This whole determinedness, and hence
also the total of feelings which it makes
possible, is to be regarded as <i>a priori</i>—i.
e. absolutely, without any action of
our own—determined. It is Kant’s <i>receptivity</i>,
and a particular of this receptivity
is an <i>affection</i>. Without it, consciousness
is unexplainable.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no doubt that it is an immediate
fact of consciousness—I feel <i>myself</i>
thus or thus determined. Now, when the
oft-lauded philosophers attempt to <i>explain</i>
this feeling, is it not clear that they attempt
to append something to it which is
not immediately involved in the fact? and
how can they do this, except through
thinking, and through a thinking according
to a category, which category is here that
of the real ground? Now, if they have
not an immediate contemplation of the
thing <i>per se</i> and its relations, what else
can they possibly know of this category,
but that they are compelled to think according
to it? They assert nothing but
that <i>they</i> are compelled to add in thought
a thing as the ground of this feeling. But
this we cheerfully admit in regard to the
standpoint which they occupy. Their
thing is produced by their thinking; and
now it is at the same time to be a thing
<i>per se</i>, i. e. not produced by thinking.</p>

<p class='c006'>I really do not comprehend them; I can
neither think this thought, nor think an
understanding which does think it; and
by this declaration, I hope I have done
with them forever.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>VII.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Having finished this digression, we now
return to our original intention, which
was to describe the procedure of the Science
of Knowledge, and to justify it
against the attacks of certain philosophers.
We said, the philosopher observes himself
in the act whereby he constructs for himself
the conception of himself; and we
now add, he also <i>thinks this act of his</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the philosopher, doubtless, knows
whereof he speaks; but a mere contemplation
gives no consciousness; only that is
known which is conceived and thought.
This conception or comprehension of his
activity is very well possible for the philosopher,
since he is already in possession
of experience; for he has a conception of
<i>activity in general, and as such</i>, namely,
as the opposite of the equally well known
conception of <i>Being</i>; and he also has a
conception of this <i>particular</i> activity, as
that of an <i>intelligence</i>, i. e. as simply an
ideal activity, and not the real causality of
the practical Ego; and moreover, a conception
of the peculiar character of this
particular activity as an <i>in itself returning
activity</i>, and not an activity directed upon
an external object.</p>

<p class='c006'>But here as well as everywhere it is to
be well remembered that the contemplation
is and remains the basis of the conception,
i. e. of that which is conceived in
the conception. We cannot absolutely create
or produce by thinking; we can only
think that which is immediately contemplated
by us. A thinking, which has no
contemplation for its basis, which does not
embrace a contemplation entertained in
the same undivided moment, is an empty
thinking, or is really no thinking at all.
At the utmost it may be the thinking of a
mere sign of the conception, and if this
sign is a word, as seems likely, the mere
thoughtless utterance of this word. I determine
my contemplation by the thinking
of an opposite; this and nothing else is
the meaning of the expression—I comprehend
the contemplation.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Through thinking, the activity, which
the philosopher thinks, becomes <i>objective</i>
to him, i. e. it floats before him, in so far as
he thinks it, as something which checks
or limits the freedom (the undeterminedness)
of his thinking. This is the true
and original significance of objectivity.
As certain as I think, I think a determined
something; or, in other words, the freedom
of my thinking, which might have been directed
upon an infinite manifold of objects,
is now, when I think, only directed upon
that limited sphere of my thinking which
the present object fills. It is limited to
this sphere. <i>I restrict myself</i> with freedom
to this sphere, if I contemplate <i>myself</i>
in the doing of it. <i>I am restricted</i> by
this sphere, if I contemplate only the <i>object</i>
and forget myself, as is universally done
on the standpoint of common thinking.
What I have just now said is intended to
correct the following objections and misunderstandings.</p>

<p class='c006'>All thinking is necessarily directed upon
a being, say some. Now the Ego of the
Science of Knowledge is not to have being;
hence it is unthinkable, and the whole
Science, which is built upon such a contradiction,
is null and void.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let me be permitted to make a preliminary
remark concerning the spirit which
prompts this objection. When the wise
men, who urge it, take the conception of
the Ego as determined in the Science of
Knowledge, and examine it by the rules of
their logic, they doubtless think that conception,
for how else could they compare
and relate it to something else? If they
really could not think it, they would not
be able to say a word about it, and it
would remain altogether unknown to them.
But they have really, as we see, happily
achieved the thinking of it, and so must
be able to think it. Yet, because according
to their traditional and misconceived
rules, they <i>ought to have been</i> unable to
think it, they would now rather deny the
possibility of an act, while doing it, than
give up their rule; they would believe
an old book rather than their own consciousness.
How little can these men be
aware of what they really do! How mechanically,
and without any inner attention
and spirit, must they produce their
philosophical specimens! Master Jourdan
after all was willing to believe that he had
spoken prose all his lifetime, without
knowing it, though it did appear rather
curious; but these men, if they had been
in his place, would have proven in the
most beautiful prose that they could not
speak prose, since they did not possess
the rules of speaking prose, and since the
conditions of the possibility of a thing
must always precede its reality. Nay, if
critical idealism should continue to be a
burden to them, it is to be expected that
they will next go to Aristotle for advice as
to whether they really live, or are already
dead and buried. By doubting the possibility
of ever becoming conscious of their
freedom and Egoness, they are covertly
already doubting this very point.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their objection might therefore be summarily
put aside, since it contradicts, and
thus annihilates itself. But let us see
where the real ground of the misunderstanding
may be concealed.</p>

<p class='c006'>All thinking necessarily proceeds from
a being, say they. Now what does this
mean? If it is to mean what we have just
shown up, namely, that there is in all
thinking a thought, an object of the thinking,
to which this particular thinking confines
itself, and by which it seems to be
limited, then their premise must undoubtedly
be admitted; and it is not the Science
of Knowledge which is going to deny
it. This objectivity for the mere thinking
does doubtless also belong to the Ego,
from which the Science of Knowledge proceeds;
or, which means the same, to the
act whereby the Ego constructs itself for
itself. But it is only through thinking
and only for thinking that it has this objectivity;
it is merely an <i>ideal</i> being.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, however, the being, of their above
assertion, is to mean not a <i>mere ideal</i>, but
a <i>real</i> being, i. e. a something, limiting
not only the ideal, but also the actually
productive, the practical activity of the
Ego—that is to say, a something permanent
in time and persistent in space—then
that assertion of theirs is unwarranted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>If it were correct, no science of philosophy
were possible, for the conception of
the Ego would be unthinkable; and self-consciousness,
nay, even consciousness,
would also be impossible. If it were correct,
we, it is true, should be compelled to
stop philosophizing; but this would be no
gain to them, for they would also have to
stop refuting us. But do they not themselves
repudiate the correctness of their
assertion? Do they not think themselves
every moment of their life as free and as
having causality? Do they not, for instance,
think themselves the free, active
authors of the very sensible and very
original objections, which they bring up
from time to time against our system?
Now, is then this “themselves” something
which checks and limits their causality,
or is it not rather the very opposite of the
check, namely, the very causality itself?
I must refer them to what I have said in
§ v. on this subject. If such a sort of
being were ascribed to the Ego, the Ego
would cease to be Ego; it would become a
<i>thing</i>, and its conception would be annihilated.
It is true that afterwards—not
afterwards as a posteriority in time, but
afterwards in the series of the dependence
of thinking—we also ascribe such a being
to the Ego, which, nevertheless, remains
and must remain Ego in the original meaning
of the word; this being consisting
partly of extension and persistency in
space, <i>and in this respect it becomes a body</i>,
and partly identity and permanency in
time, and in this respect it becomes a soul.
But it is the business of philosophy to
prove, and genetically to explain how the
Ego comes to think itself thus, and all
this belongs not to that which is presupposed,
but to that which is to be deduced.
The result, therefore, remains thus: the
Ego is originally only an act<i>ing</i>; if you
but think it as an act<i>ive</i>, you have already
an Empirical, and hence a conception of it,
which must first be deduced.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But our opponents claim that they do not
make their assertion without all proof;
they want to prove it by logic, and, if God
is willing, by the logical proposition of
contradiction.</p>

<p class='c006'>If there is anything which clearly shows
the lamentable condition of philosophy as
a science in these our days, it is that such
occurrences can take place. If anybody
were to speak about mathematics, natural
sciences, or any other science, in a manner
which would indicate beyond a doubt his
complete ignorance concerning the first
principles of such a science, he would be
at once sent back to the school from which
he ran away too soon. But in philosophy
it is not to be thus. If in philosophy a
man shows in the same manner his complete
ignorance, we are, with many bows
and compliments to the sharp-sighted man,
to give him publicly that private schooling
which he so sadly needs, and without betraying
the least smile or gesture of disgust.
Have, then, the philosophers in two
thousand years made clear not a single
proposition which might now be considered
as established for that science without further
proof? If there is such a proposition,
it is certainly that of the distinction of
logic, as a purely formal science, from real
philosophy or metaphysics. But what is
really the true meaning of this terrible
logical proposition of contradiction which
is to crush at one stroke our whole system?
As far as I know, simply this: <i>if</i> a
conception is already determined by a certain
characteristic, then it must not be determined
by another opposite characteristic.
But by what characteristic the conception
is originally to be characterized,
this logical theorem does not say, nor can
say, for it presupposes the original determination,
and is applicable only in so far
as that is presupposed. Concerning the
original determination another science will
have to decide.</p>

<p class='c006'>These wise men tell us that it is <i>contradictory</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>not to determine a conception by
the predicate of actual being. Yet how
can this be contradictory, unless the conception
has first been thus determined by
the predicate of actual being, and has
then had that predicate denied to it? But
who authorized them to determine the conception
by that predicate? Do not these
adepts in logic perceive that they postulate
their principle, and turn around in an evident
circle? Whether there really be a
conception, which is originally—by the
laws of the synthetizing, not of the merely
analyzing reason—<i>not determined by that
predicate of actual being</i>, this they will
have to go and learn from contemplation;
logic only warns them against afterwards
again applying the same predicate to that
conception; of course also, in the same
respect, in which they have denied the determinability
of the conception by that
predicate.</p>

<p class='c006'>But certainly if they have not yet elevated
themselves to <i>the consciousness</i> of
that contemplation, which is not determined
by the predicate of being, (for that
they should unconsciously possess that
contemplation itself, Reason herself has
taken care of,) then <i>all their</i> conceptions,
which can be derived only from sensuous
contemplation, are very properly determined
by the predicate of this actual being.
In that case, however, they must not believe
that logic has taught them this asserted
connection of thinking and being, for
their knowledge of it is altogether derived
from their unfortunate empirical self.
They, standing on the standpoint of knowing
no other conceptions than those derived
from sensuous contemplation, would, of
course, contradict <i>themselves</i> if they were
to think one of <i>their</i> conceptions without
the predicate of actual being. We, on our
part, are also well content to let them retain
this rule for themselves, since it is
most assuredly universally valid for the
whole sphere of <i>their</i> possible thinking;
and to let them always carefully keep an
eye on this rule, so that they may not violate
it. As for ourselves, however, we cannot
use this their rule any longer, for we
possess a few conceptions more, resting in
a sphere over which their rule does not extend,
and about which they can speak
nothing, since it does not exist for them.
Let them, therefore, attend to their own
business hereafter, and leave us to attend
to ours. Even in so far as we grant them
the rule, namely, that every thinking
must have an object of thinking; it is by
no means a logical rule, but rather one
which logic presupposes, and through which
logic first becomes possible. <i>To think</i>, is the
same as to determine objects; both conceptions
are identical; logic furnishes the
<i>rules</i> of this determining, and hence presupposes
clearly enough the determining
generally as a part of consciousness. That
all thinking has an object can be shown
only in contemplation. Think! and observe
in this thinking how you do it, and
you will doubtless find that you oppose
to your thinking an object of this thinking.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another objection, somewhat related to
the above, is this: If you do not proceed
from a being, how can you, without being
illogical, deduce a being? You will never
be able to get anything else out of what
you take in hand than what is already contained
in it, unless you proceed dishonestly
and use juggler tricks.</p>

<p class='c006'>I reply: Nor do we deduce being in the
sense in which you use the word, i. e. as
<i>being</i>, <i>per se</i>. What the philosopher takes
up is an <i>acting</i>, which acts according to
certain laws, and what he establishes is
the series of necessary acts of this acting.
Amongst these acts there occurs one which
to the acting itself appears as a being, and
which by laws to be shown up, <i>must</i> so appear
to it. The philosopher who observes
the acting from a higher standpoint, never
ceases to regard it as an acting. A being
exists only for the observed Ego, which
thinks realistically; but for the philosopher
there is acting, and only acting, for
he thinks idealistically.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let me express it on this occasion in all
clearness: The essence of transcendental
idealism generally, and of the Science of
Knowledge particularly, consists in this,
that the conception of being is not at all
viewed as a <i>first</i> and <i>original</i> conception,
but simply as a <i>derived</i> conception; derived
from the opposition of activity.
Hence it is considered only as a <i>negative</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>conception. The only positive for the
idealist is <i>Freedom</i>; being is the mere
negative of freedom. Only thus has idealism
a firm basis, and is in harmony with
itself. But dogmatism, which believed
itself safely reposing upon being, as a basis
no further to be investigated or grounded,
regards this assertion as a stupidity
and horror, for it is its annihilation.
That wherein the dogmatist, amongst all
the inflictions which he has experienced
from time to time, still found a hiding
place—namely, some original being, though
it were but a raw and formless <i>matter</i>—is
now utterly destroyed, and he stands naked
and defenceless. He has no weapons
against this attack except the assurance of
his hearty disgust, and his confession, that
he does not understand, and positively cannot
and will not think, what is required of
him. We cheerfully give credence to this
statement, and only beg that he will also
place faith in our assurance, that we find
it not at all difficult to think our system.
Nay, if this should be too much for him, we
can even abstain from it, and leave him to
believe whatever he chooses on this point.
That we do not and cannot force him to
adopt our system, because its adoption depends
upon freedom, has already been
often enough admitted.</p>

<p class='c006'>I say that the dogmatist has nothing left
but the assurance of his incapacity, for
the idea of intrenching himself behind
general logic, and conjuring the shade of
the Stagirite, because he knows not how
to defend his own body, is altogether new,
and will find few imitators even in this
universal state of despair; since the least
school knowledge of what logic really is,
will suffice to make every one reject this
protection.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let no one be deceived by these opponents,
if they adopt the language of idealism,
and admitting with their lips the correctness
of its views, protest that they
know well enough that being is only to
signify <i>being for us</i>. They are dogmatists.
For every one who asserts that all thinking
and consciousness must proceed from a
being, makes being something primary;
and it is this which constitutes dogmatism.
By such a confusion of speech they but
demonstrate the utter confusion of their
conceptions; for what may a <i>being for us</i>
mean, which is, nevertheless, to be an
original <i>not</i>-derived being? Who, then,
are those “<i>we</i>,” for whom alone this being
is? Are they <i>intelligences</i> as such? Then
the statement “there is something for the
intelligence,” signifies, this something is
represented by the intelligence; and the
statement “it is <i>only</i> for the intelligence,”
signifies, it is <i>only</i> represented. Hence the
conception of a being, which, from a certain
point of view, is to be independent of
the representation, must, after all, be derived
from the representation, since it is to
be, only through it; and these men would,
therefore, be more in harmony with the
Science of Knowledge than they believed.
Or are those “<i>we</i>” themselves things,
original things, things in themselves?
How, then, can anything be <i>for</i> them; how
can they even be for themselves, since the
conception of a thing involves merely that
it is, but not that the thing is <i>for itself</i>?
What may the word <i>for</i> signify to them?
Is it, perhaps, but an innocent adornment
which they have adopted for the sake of
fashion?</p>
<h4 class='c012'>VIII.</h4>
<p class='c005'>The Science of Knowledge has said, “It
is not possible to abstract from the Ego.”
This assertion may be regarded from two
points of view—either from the standpoint
of common consciousness, and then it
means, “We never have another representation
than that of ourselves; throughout
our whole life, and in all moments of our
life, we think only I, I, I, and nothing but
I.” Or it may be viewed from the standpoint
of the philosopher, and then it will
have the following significance: “The Ego
must necessarily be added in thought to
whatever occurs in consciousness;” or as
Kant expresses it, “All my representations
must be thought as accompanied by—I
think.” What nonsense were it to maintain
the first interpretation to be the true
one, and what wretchedness to refute it in
that interpretation. But in the latter interpretation
the assertion of the Science of
Knowledge will doubtless be acceptable to
every one who is but able to understand it;
and if it had only been thus understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>before, we should long ago have been rid
of the thing <i>per se</i>, for it would have been
seen that we are always the Thinking,
whatever we may think, and that hence
nothing can occur in us which is independent
of us, because it all is necessarily related
to our thinking.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IX.</h4>
<p class='c005'>“But,” confess other opponents of the
Science of Knowledge, “as far as our own
persons are concerned, we cannot, under
the conception of the Ego, think anything
else than our own dear persons as opposed
to other persons. Ego (I) signifies my particular
person, named, for instance, Caius
or Sempronius, as distinguished from other
persons not so named. Now, if I should
abstract, as the Science of Knowledge requires
me to do, from this individual personality,
there would be nothing left to me
which might be characterized as <i>I</i>; I might
just as well call the remainder <i>It</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, what is the real meaning of this
objection, so boldly put forth? Does it
speak of the original real synthesis of the
conception of the individual (their own
dear persons and other persons), and do
they therefore mean to say, “there is nothing
synthetized in this conception but the
conception of an object generally—of the
<i>It</i>, and of other objects (<i>Its</i>)—from which
the first one is distinguished?” Or does
that objection fly for protection to the
common use of language, and do they
therefore mean to say, “In language, the
word I (Ego) signifies only individuality?”
As far as the first is concerned, every one,
who is as yet possessed of his senses,
must see that by distinguishing one object
from its equals, i. e. from other objects,
we arrive only at a <i>determined object</i>, but
not at a determined <i>person</i>. The synthesis
of the conception of the personality is
quite different. The <i>Egoness</i> (the in itself
returning activity, the subject-objectivity,
or whatever you choose to call it,) is originally
opposed to the <i>It</i>, to the mere objectivity;
and the positing of these conceptions
is absolute, is conditioned by no
other positing, is thetical, not synthetical.
This conception of the Egoness, which has
arisen in our Self, is now transferred to
something, which in the first positing was
posited as an <i>It</i>, as mere object, and is
synthetically united with it; and it is only
through this conditional synthesis that
there first arises for us a <i>Thou</i>. The conception
of Thou arises from the union of the
It and the I. The conception of the Ego in
this opposition; hence, as conception of the
individual, is the synthesis of the I with
itself. That which posits itself in the described
act, not generally, but <i>as Ego</i>, is
I; and that which in the same act is
posited as Ego, not <i>through itself</i>, but
<i>through me</i>, is Thou. Now it is doubtless
possible to abstract from this product of a
synthesis, for what we ourselves have synthetized
we doubtless can analyze again,
and when we so abstract, the remainder
will be the general Ego, i. e. the not-object.
Taken in this interpretation, the objection
would be simply absurd.</p>

<p class='c006'>But how if our opponents cling to the use
of language? Even if it is true that the
word “I” has hitherto signified in language
only the individual, would this make
it necessary that a distinction in the original
synthesis is not to be remarked and
named, simply because it has never before
been noticed? But is it true? Of what
use of language do they speak? Of the
philosophical language? I have shown
already that Kant uses the conception of
the pure Ego in the same meaning I attach
to it. If he says, “I am the thinking
in this thinking,” does he then only oppose
himself to other persons, and not
rather to all object of thinking generally?
Kant says again, “The fundamental principle
of the necessary unity of apperception
is itself identical, and hence an analytical
proposition.” This signifies precisely what
I have just stated, i. e. that the Ego arises
through no synthesis, the manifold whereof
might be further analyzed, but through an
absolute thesis. But this Ego is the <i>Egoness</i>
generally; for the conception of individuality
arises clearly enough through
synthesis, as I have just shown; and the
fundamental principle of individuality is
therefore a synthetical proposition. Reinhold,
it is true, speaks of the Ego simply
as of the representing; but this does not
affect the present case; for when I distinguish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>myself as the representing from
the represented, do I then distinguish myself
from other persons, and not rather
from all object of representation as such?
But take even the case of these same much
lauded philosophers, who do not, like Kant
and like the Science of Knowledge, presuppose
the Ego in advance of the manifold
of representation, but rather heap it
together, out of that manifold; do they,
then, hold their one thinking in the manifold
thinking to be only the thinking of
the individual, and not rather of the intelligence
generally? In one word: is there
any philosopher of repute, who before
them has ventured to discover that the Ego
signifies only the individual, and that if
the individuality is abstracted from, only
an object in general remains?</p>

<p class='c006'>Or do they mean ordinary use of language?
To prove this use, I am compelled
to cite instances from common life.
If you call to anybody in the darkness
“Who is there?” and he, presupposing
that his voice is well-known to you, replies,
“It is I,” then it is clear that he
speaks of himself as this particular person,
and wishes to be understood: “It is I, who
am named thus or thus, and it is not any
one of all the others, named otherwise;”
and he so desires to be understood, because
your question, “<i>Who</i> is there?”
presupposes already that it is a rational
being who is there, and expresses only that
you wish to know which particular one
amongst all the rational beings it may be.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if you should, for instance—permit
me this example, which I find particularly
applicable—sew or cut at the clothing
of some person, and should unawares
cut the person himself, then he would
probably cry out: “Look here, this is <i>I</i>;
you are cutting <i>me</i>!” Now, what does he
mean to express thereby? Not that he is
this particular person, named thus or thus,
and none other; for that you know very
well; but that that which was cut was
not his dead and senseless clothing, but
his living and sensitive self, which you
did not know before. By this “It is <i>I</i>,”
the person does not distinguish himself
from other <i>persons</i>, but from <i>things</i>. This
distinction occurs continually in life; and
we cannot take a step or move our hand
without making it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In short, Egoness and Individuality are
very different conceptions, and the synthesis
of the latter is clearly to be observed.
Through the former conception,
we distinguish ourselves from all that is
external to us—not merely from all <i>persons</i>
that are external to us—and hence
we embrace by it not our particular personality,
but our general spirituality. It
is in this sense that the word is used, both
in philosophical and in common language.
The above objection testifies, therefore,
not only to an unusual want of thought,
but also to great ignorance in philosophical
literature.</p>

<p class='c006'>But our opponents insist on their incapability
to think the required conception,
and we must place faith in their assertions.
Not that they lack the general
conception of the pure Ego, for if they
did, they would be obliged to desist from
raising objections, just as a piece of log
must desist. But it is the <i>conception of
this conception</i> which they lack, and which
they cannot attain. They have that conception
in themselves, but do not know
<i>that</i> they have it. The ground of this
their incapability does not lie in any particular
weakness of their thinking faculties,
but in a weakness of their whole
character. Their Ego, in the sense in
which they take the word—i. e. their individual
person—is the last object of their
acting, and hence also the limit of their
explicit thinking. It is to them, therefore,
the only true substance, and reason is only
an accident thereof. Their person does
not exist as a particular expression of reason;
but reason exists to help their person
through the world; and if the person
could get along just as well without reason,
we might discharge reason from service,
and there would be no reason at all.
This, indeed, lurks in the whole system
of their conceptions, and through all
their assertions, and many of them are
honest enough not to conceal it. Now,
they are quite correct as far as they assert
this incapacity in respect to their own
persons—they only must not state as objective
that which has merely subjective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>validity. In the Science of Knowledge
the relation is exactly reversed: Reason
alone is in itself, and individuality is but
accidental; reason is the object, and personality
the means to realize it; personality
is only a particular manner of manifesting
reason, and must always more and
more lose itself in the universal form of
reason. Only reason is eternal; individuality
must always die out. And whosoever
is not prepared to succumb to this
order of things, will also never get at the
true understanding of the Science of
Knowledge.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>X.</h4>
<p class='c005'>This fact that they can never understand
the Science of Knowledge unless
they first comply with certain conditions,
has been told them often enough. They
do not want to hear it again, and our
frank warning affords them a new opportunity
to attack us. Every conviction,
they assert, must be capable of being communicated
by conceptions—nay, it must
even be possible to compel its acknowledgment.
They say it is a bad example
to assert that our Science exists for only
certain privileged spirits, and that others
cannot see or understand anything of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us see, first of all, what the Science
of Knowledge does assert on this point.
It does not assert that there is an original
and inborn distinction between men and
men, whereby some are made capable of
thinking and learning what the others, by
their nature, cannot think or learn. Reason
is common to all, and is the same in
all rational beings. Whatsoever one rational
being possesses as a talent, all
others possess also. Nay, we have even in
this present article expressly admitted
that the conceptions upon which the
Science of Knowledge insists, are actually
effective in all rational beings; for their
efficacy furnishes the ground of a possibility
of consciousness. The pure Ego,
which they charge is incapable of thinking,
lies at the bottom of all their thinking,
and occurs in all their thinking, since
all thinking is possible only through it.
Thus far everything proceeds mechanically.
But to get an insight into this
asserted necessity—to think again this
thinking—does not lie in mechanism, but,
on the contrary, requires an elevation,
through <i>freedom</i>, to a new sphere, which
our immediate existence does not place in
our possession. Unless this faculty of
freedom has already existence, and has
already been practised, the Science of
Knowledge can accomplish nothing in a
person. It is this power of freedom which
furnishes the premises upon which the
structure is to rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>They certainly will not deny that every
science and every art presupposes certain
primary rudiments, which must first be
acquired before we can enter into the
science or art. “But,” say they, “if you
only require a knowledge of the rudiments,
why do you not teach them to us, if we
lack them? Why do you not place them
before us definitely and systematically?
Is it not your own fault if you plunge us at
once <i>in medias res</i>, and require the public
to understand you before you have
communicated the rudiments?” I reply:
that is exactly the difficulty! These rudiments
cannot be systematically forced
upon you—they cannot be taught to you
by compulsion! In one word, they are a
knowledge which we can get only from
ourselves. Everything depends upon this,
that by the constant use of freedom, with
<i>clear consciousness</i> of this freedom, we
should become thoroughly conscious and
enamored of this our freedom. Whenever
it shall have become the well-matured object
of education—from tenderest youth
upwards—to <i>develop</i> the inner power of
the scholar, but not to <i>give it a direction</i>;
to educate man for his own use, and as
instrument of his own will, but not as the
soulless instrument of others;—then the
Science of Knowledge will be universally
and easily comprehensible. Culture of the
whole man, from earliest youth—this is
the only way to spread philosophy. Education
must first content itself to be more
negative than positive—more a mutual interchange
<i>with</i> the scholar than a working
<i>upon</i> him; more negative as far as possible—i. e.
education must at least propose
to itself this negativeness as its object,
and must be positive only as a means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>being negative. So long as education,
whether with or without clear consciousness,
proposes to itself the opposite object—labors
only for usefulness through others,
without considering that the using principle
lies also in the individual; so long as
education thus eradicates in earliest youth
the root of self-activity, and accustoms
man not to determine himself but to
await a determination through others—so
long, talent for philosophy will always remain
an extraordinary favor of nature,
which cannot be further explained, and
which may therefore be called by the
indefinite expression of “philosophical
genius.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The chief ground of all the errors of
our opponents may perhaps be this, that
they have never yet made clear to themselves
what <i>proving</i> means, and that hence
they have never considered that there is
at the bottom of all demonstration something
absolutely undemonstrable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Demonstration effects only a conditioned,
mediated certainty; by virtue of
it, something is certain if another thing is
certain. If any doubt arises as to the
certainty of this other, then this certainty
must again be appended to the certainty of
a third, and so on. Now, is this retrogression
carried on <i>ad infinitum</i>, or is there
anywhere a final link? I know very well
that some are of the former opinion; but
these men have never considered that if it
were so, they would not even be capable
of entertaining the idea of certainty—no,
not even of hunting after certainty.
For what this may mean: to be certain;
they only know by being themselves certain
of something; but if everything is
certain only on condition, then nothing is
certain, and there is even no conditioned
certainty. But if there is a final link, regarding
which no question can be raised,
why it is certain, then, there is an undemonstrable
at the base of all demonstration.</p>

<p class='c006'>They do not appear to have considered
what it means: to have proven something
to <i>somebody</i>. It means: we have demonstrated
to him that a certain other certainty
is contained, by virtue of the laws
of thinking, which he admits, in a certain
first certainty which he assumes or admits,
and that he must necessarily assume the
first if he assumes the second, as he says
he does. Hence all communication of a
conviction by proof, presupposes that both
parts are at least agreed on something.
Now, how could the Science of Knowledge
communicate itself to the dogmatist, since
they are positively <i>not agreed in a single
point</i>, so far as the <i>material</i> of knowledge
is concerned, and since thus the common
point is wanting from which they might
jointly start.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Finally, they seem not to have considered
that even where there is such a common
point, no one can think into the soul
of the other; that each must calculate
upon the self-activity of the other, and
cannot furnish him the necessary
thoughts, but can merely advise how to
construct or think those thoughts. The
relation between free beings is a reciprocal
influence upon each other through
freedom, but not a causality through
mechanically effective power. And thus the
present dispute returns to the chief point
of dispute, from which all our differences
arise. They presuppose everywhere the
relation of causality, because they indeed
know no higher relation; and it is upon
this that they base their demand: we
ought to graft our conviction on their
souls without any activity on their own
part. But we proceed from freedom, and—which
is but fair—presuppose freedom
in them. Moreover, in thus presupposing
the universal validity of the mechanism
of cause and effect, they immediately contradict
themselves; what they say and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>what they do, are in palpable contradiction.
For, in <i>presupposing</i> the mechanism of
cause and effect, they elevate themselves
beyond it; their thinking of the mechanism
is not contained in the mechanism itself.
The mechanism cannot seize itself,
for the simple reason that it is mechanism.
Only free consciousness can seize
itself. Here, therefore, would be a way
to convince them of their error. But the
difficulty is that this thought lies utterly
beyond the range of their vision, and that
they lack the agility of mind to think,
when they think an object, not only the
object, but also their thinking of the object;
wherefore this present remark is
utterly incomprehensible to them, and is
indeed written only for those who are
awake and see.</p>

<p class='c006'>We reiterate, therefore, our assurance:
we <i>will</i> not convince them, because one
cannot <i>will</i> an impossibility; and we will
not refute their system for them, because
we cannot. True, we can refute it easily
enough <i>for us</i>; it is very easy to throw it
down—the mere breath of a free man destroys
it. But we cannot refute it for
<i>them</i>. We do not write, speak or teach
<i>for them</i>, since there is positively no point
from which we could reach them. If we
speak <i>of</i> them, it is not for their own
sake, but for the sake of others—to warn
these against their errors, and persuade
these not to listen to their empty and insignificant
prattle. Now, they must not
consider this, our declaration, as degrading
for them. By so doing, they but
evince their bad conscience, and publicly
degrade themselves amongst us. Besides,
they are in the same position in regard to
us. They also cannot refute or convince
us, or say anything, which could have an
effect upon us. This we confess ourselves,
and would not be in the least indignant if
they said it. What we tell them, we tell
them not at all with the evil purpose of
causing them anger, but merely to save us
and them unnecessary trouble. We should
be truly glad if they were thus to accept
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, there is nothing degrading in
the matter itself. Every one who to-day
charges his brother with this incapacity,
has once been necessarily in the same condition.
For we all are born in it, and it
requires time to get beyond it. If our
opponents would only not be driven into
indignation by our declaration, but would
reflect about it, and inquire whether there
might not be some truth in it, they might
then probably get out of that incapacity.
They would at once be our equals, and
we could henceforth live in perfect peace
together. The fault is not ours, if we
occasionally are pretty hard at war with
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>From all this it also appears, which I
consider expedient to remark here, that a
philosophy, in order to be a science, need
not be <i>universally valid</i>, as some philosophers
seem to assume. These philosophers
demand the impossible. What does it
mean: a philosophy is really universally
valid? Who, then, are all these for
whom it is to be valid? I suppose not to
every one who has a human face, for then
it would also have to be valid for children
and for the common man, for whom
thinking is never object, but always the
means for his real purpose. Universally
valid, then, for the philosophers? But
who, then, are the philosophers? I hope
not all those who have received the degree
of doctor from some philosophical faculty,
or who have printed something which they
call philosophical, or who, perhaps, are
themselves members of some philosophical
faculty? Indeed, how shall we even
have a fixed conception of the philosopher,
unless we have first a fixed conception of
philosophy—i. e. unless we first possess
that fixed philosophy? It is quite certain
that all those who believe themselves possessed
of philosophy, as a science, will
deny to all those who do not recognize
their philosophy the name of philosopher,
and hence will make the acknowledgment
of their philosophy the criterion of a
philosopher. This they must do, if they
will proceed logically, for there is only
one philosophy. The author of the
Science of Knowledge, for instance, has
long ago stated that he is of this opinion
in regard to his system—not in so far as
it is an <i>individual representation</i> of that
system, but in so far as it is a system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span><i>transcendental idealism</i>—and he hesitates
not a moment to repeat this assertion.
But does not this lead us into an evident
circle? Every one will then say, “My philosophy
is universally valid for all philosophers;”
and will say so with full right if
he only be himself convinced, though no
other mortal being should accept his doctrine;
“for,” he will add, “he who does
not recognize it as valid is no philosopher.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Concerning this point, I hold the following:
If there be but one man who is fully
and at all times equally convinced of his
philosophy, who is in complete harmony
with himself in this his philosophy, whose
free judgment in philosophizing agrees
perfectly with the judgment daily life
forces upon him, then in this one man
philosophy has fulfilled its purpose and
completed its circle; for it has put him
down again at the very same point from
which he started with all mankind; and
henceforth philosophy as a science really
exists, though no other man else should
comprehend and accept it; nay, though
that one man might not even know how to
teach it to others.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let no one here offer the trivial objection
that all systematic authors have ever
been convinced of the truth of their systems.
For this assertion is utterly false,
and is grounded only in this, that few
know what conviction really is. This can
only be experienced by having the fullness
of conviction in one’s self. Those authors
were only convinced of one or the
other point in their system, which perhaps
was not even clearly conscious to themselves,
but not of the whole of their system—they
were convinced only in certain
moods. This is no conviction. Conviction
is that which depends on no time and
no change of condition; which is not accidental
to the soul, but which is the soul
itself. One can be convinced only of the
unchangeably and eternally True: to be
convinced of error is impossible. But of
such true convictions very few examples
may probably exist in the history of philosophy;
perhaps but one; perhaps not
even this one. I do not speak of the ancients.
It is even doubtful whether they
ever proposed to themselves the great
problem of philosophy. But let me speak
of modern authors. Spinoza could not be
convinced; he could only <i>think</i>, not <i>put
faith</i> in his philosophy; for it was in direct
contradiction with his necessary conviction
in daily life, by virtue of which he
was forced to consider himself free and
self-determined. He could be convinced
of it only in so far as it contained truth,
or as it contained a part of philosophy as
a science. He was clearly convinced that
mere objective reasoning would necessarily
lead to his system; for in that he was
correct; but it never occurred to him that
in thinking he ought to reflect upon his
own thinking, and in that he was wrong,
and thus made his speculation contradictory
to his life. Kant might have been
convinced; but, if I understand him correctly,
he was not convinced when he
wrote his <i>Critique</i>. He speaks of <i>a deception,
which always recurs, although we
know that it is a deception</i>. Whence did
Kant learn, as he was the first who discovered
this pretended deception, that it
always recurs, and in whom could he have
made the experience that it did so recur?
Only in himself. But to know that one
deceives one’s self, and still to deceive
one’s self is not the condition of conviction
and harmony within—it is the symptom
of a dangerous inner disharmony.
My experience is that no deception recurs,
for reason contains no deception. Moreover,
of what deception does Kant speak?
Clearly of the belief that things <i>per se</i>
exist externally and independent of us.
But who entertains this belief? Not common
consciousness, surely, for common
consciousness only speaks <i>of itself</i>, and
can therefore say nothing but that things
exist for it (i. e. for us, on this standpoint
of common consciousness); and that certainly
is no deception, for it is our own
truth. Common consciousness knows
nothing of a thing <i>per se</i>, for the very reason
that it is common consciousness,
which surely never goes beyond itself. It
is a false philosophy which first makes
common consciousness assert such a conception,
whilst only that false philosophy
discovered it in <i>its</i> own sphere. Hence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>this so-called deception—which is easily
got rid of, and which true philosophy roots
out utterly—that false philosophy has itself
produced, and as soon as you get
your philosophy perfected, the scales will
fall from your eyes, and the deception
will never recur. You will, in all your
life thereafter, never believe to know more
than that you are finite, and finite in <i>this
determined</i> manner, which you must explain
to yourself, by the existence of <i>such
a determined world</i>; and you will no more
think of breaking through this limit than
of ceasing to be yourself. Leibnitz, also,
may have been convinced, for, properly
understood—and why should he not have
properly understood himself?—he is right.
Nay, more—if highest ease and freedom
of mind may suggest conviction; if the
ingenuity to fit one’s philosophy into all
forms, and apply it to all parts of human
knowledge—the power to scatter all doubts
as soon as they appear, and the manner of
using one’s philosophy more as an instrument
than as an object, may testify of
perfect clearness; and if self-reliance,
cheerfulness and high courage in life may
be signs of inner harmony, then Leibnitz
was perhaps convinced, and the only example
of conviction in the history of philosophy.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>XI.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In conclusion, I wish to refer in a few
words to a very curious misapprehension.
It is that of mistaking the Ego, as intellectual
contemplation, from which the Science
of Knowledge proceeds, for the Ego,
as idea, with which it concludes. In the
Ego, as intellectual contemplation, we
have only the form of the Egoness, the
in itself returning activity, sufficiently described
above. The Ego in this form is
only <i>for the philosopher</i>, and by seizing it
thus, you enter philosophy. The Ego, as
idea, on the contrary, is <i>for the Ego</i> itself,
which the philosopher considers. He does
not establish the latter Ego as his own,
but as the idea of the natural but perfectly
cultured man; just as a real being does
not exist for the philosopher, but merely
for the Ego he observes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Ego as idea is the rational being—firstly,
in so far as it completely represents
in itself the universal reason, or as it is
altogether rational and only rational, and
hence it must also have ceased to be individual,
which it was only through sensuous
limitation; and secondly, in so far as
this rational being has also realized reason
in the eternal world, which, therefore, remains
constantly posited in this idea. The
world remains in this idea as world generally,
as <i>substratum</i> with these determined
mechanical and organic laws; but all these
laws are perfectly suited to represent the
final object of reason. The idea of the Ego
and the Ego of the intellectual contemplation
have only this in common, that in neither
of them the thought of the individual
enters; not in the latter, because the Egoness
has not yet been determined as individuality;
and not in the former, because
the determination of individuality
has vanished through universal culture.
But both are opposites in this, that the
Ego of the contemplation contains only
the <i>form</i> of the Ego, and pays no regard
to an actual material of the same, which
is only thinkable by its thinking of a
world; while in the Ego of the Idea the
complete material of the Egoness is
thought. From the first conception all
philosophy proceeds, and it is its fundamental
conception; to the latter it does
not return, but only determines this idea
in the practical part as highest and ultimate
object of reason. The first is, as we
have said, original contemplation, and becomes
a conception in the sufficiently described
manner; the latter is only idea, it
cannot be thought determinately and will
never be actual, but will always more and
more approximate to the actuality.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>XII.</h4>
<p class='c005'>These are, I believe, all the misunderstandings
which are to be taken into consideration,
and to correct which a clear
explanation may hope somewhat to aid.
Other modes of working against the new
system cannot and need not be met by me.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a system, for instance, the beginning
and end, nay, the whole essence of which,
is that individuality be theoretically forgotten
and practically denied, is denounced as
egotism, and by men who, for the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>reason because they are covertly theoretical
egotists and overtly practical egotists,
cannot elevate themselves into an insight
into this system; if a conclusion is drawn
from the system that its author has an
evil heart, and if again from this evil-heartedness
of the author the conclusion is
drawn that the system is false; then arguments
are of no avail; for those who make
these assertions know very well that they
are not true, and they have quite different
reasons for uttering them than because
they believed them. The system bothers
them little enough; but the author may,
perhaps, have stated on other occasions
things which do not please them, and may,
perhaps—God knows, how or where!—be
in their way. Now such persons are perfectly
in conformity with their mode of
thinking, and it would be an idle undertaking
to attempt to rid them of their nature.
But if thousands and thousands
who know not a word of the Science of
Knowledge, nor have occasion to know a
word of it, who are neither Jews nor Pagans,
neither aristocrats nor democrats,
neither Kantians of the old or of the
modern school, or of any school, and who
even are not originals—who might have a
grudge against the author of the Science
of Knowledge, because he took away from
them the original ideas which they have
just prepared for the public—if such men
hastily take hold of these charges, and
repeat and repeat them again without any
apparent interest, other than that they
might appear well instructed regarding the
secrets of the latest literature; then it
may, indeed, be hoped that for their own
sakes they will take our prayer into consideration,
and reflect upon what they wish
to say before they say it.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>INTRODUCTION TO IDEALISM. <br /> [From the German of <span class='sc'>Schelling</span>. Translated by <span class='sc'>Tom Davidson</span>.]</h3>
<h4 class='c012'>I.—IDEA OF TRANSCENDENTAL PHILOSOPHY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. All knowing is based upon the agreement
of an objective with a subjective.
For we <i>know</i> only the true, and truth is
universally held to be the agreement of
representations with their objects.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The sum of all that is purely objective
in our knowledge we may call Nature;
while the sum of all that is subjective may
be designated the <i>Ego</i>, or Intelligence.
These two concepts are mutually opposed.
Intelligence is originally conceived as that
which solely represents—Nature as that
which is merely capable of representation;
the former as the conscious—the latter as
the unconscious. There is, moreover,
necessary in all knowledge a mutual agreement
of the two—the conscious and the
unconscious <i>per se</i>. The problem is to
explain this agreement.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. In knowledge itself, in my knowing,
objective and subjective are so united that
it is impossible to say to which of the two
the priority belongs. There is here no
first and no second—the two are contemporaneous
and one. In my efforts to explain
this identity, I must first have it undone.
In order to explain it, inasmuch as
nothing else is given me as a principle of
explanation beyond these two factors of
knowledge, I must of necessity place the
one before the other—set out from the one
in order from it to arrive at the other.
From which of the two I am to set out is
not determined by the problem.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. There are, therefore, only two cases
possible:</p>

<p class='c006'>A. <i>Either the objective is made the first,
and the question comes to be how a subjective
agreeing with it is superinduced.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The idea of the subjective is not contained
in the idea of the objective; they
rather mutually exclude each other. The
subjective, therefore, must be <i>superinduced</i>
upon the objective. It forms no part of
the conception of Nature that there should
be something intelligent to represent it.
Nature, to all appearance, would exist
even were there nothing to represent it.
The problem may therefore likewise be expressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>thus: How is the Intelligent superinduced
upon Nature? or, How comes
Nature to be represented?</p>

<p class='c006'>The problem assumes Nature, or the objective,
as first. It is, therefore, manifestly,
a problem of natural science, which
does the same. That natural science really,
and without knowing it, approximates, at
least, to the solution of this problem can
be shown here only briefly.</p>

<p class='c006'>If all knowledge has, as it were, two
poles, which mutually suppose and demand
each other, they must reciprocally
be objects of search in all sciences.
There must, therefore, of necessity, be
two fundamental sciences; and it must
be impossible to set out from the one pole
without being driven to the other. The
necessary tendency of all natural science,
therefore, is to pass from Nature to the
intelligent. This, and this alone, lies at
the bottom of the effort to bring theory
into natural phenomena. The final perfection
of natural science would be the
complete mentalization of all the laws of
Nature into laws of thought. The phenomena,
that is, the material, must vanish
entirely, and leave only the laws—that is,
the formal. Hence it is that the more the
accordance with law is manifested in Nature
itself, the more the wrappage disappears—the
phenomena themselves become
more mental, and at last entirely cease.
Optical phenomena are nothing more than
a geometry whose lines are drawn through
the light; and even this light itself is of
doubtful materiality. In the phenomena
of magnetism all trace of matter has already
disappeared, and of those of gravitation;
which even physical philosophers
believed could be attributed only to direct
spiritual influence, there remains nothing
but the law, whose action on a large scale
is the mechanism of the heavenly motions.
The complete theory of Nature would be
that whereby the whole of Nature should
be resolved into an intelligence. The
dead and unconscious products of Nature
are only unsuccessful attempts of Nature
to reflect itself, and dead Nature, so-called,
is merely an unripe Intelligence; hence in
its phenomena the intelligent character
peers through, though yet unconsciously.
Its highest aim, namely, that of becoming
completely self-objective, Nature reaches
only in its highest and last reflection,
which is nothing else than man, or, more
generally, what we call reason, by means
of which Nature turns completely back
upon itself, and by which is manifested
that Nature is originally identical with
what in us is known as intelligent and conscious.</p>

<p class='c006'>This may perhaps suffice to prove that
natural science has a necessary tendency
to render Nature intelligent. By this very
tendency it is that it becomes natural philosophy,
which is one of the two necessary
fundamental sciences of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>B. <i>Or the subjective is made the first,
and the problem is, how an objective is
superinduced agreeing with it.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>If all knowledge is based upon the
agreement of these two, then the task of
explaining this agreement is plainly the
highest for all knowledge; and if, as is
generally admitted, philosophy is the
highest and loftiest of all sciences, it is
certainly the main task of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the problem demands only the explanation
of that agreement generally, and
leaves it entirely undecided where the explanation
shall begin, what it shall make its
first, and what its second. Moreover, as the
two opposites are mutually necessary to
each other, the result of the operation
must be the same, from whichever point it
sets out.</p>

<p class='c006'>To make the objective the first, and derive
the subjective from it, is, as has just
been shown, the task of natural philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, therefore, there is a transcendental
philosophy, the only course that remains
for it is the opposite one, namely: to set
out from the subjective as the first and the
absolute, and deduce the origin of the objective
from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Into these two possible directions of
philosophy, therefore, natural and transcendental
philosophy have separated
themselves; and if all philosophy must
have for its aim to make either an Intelligence
out of Nature or a Nature out of Intelligence,
then transcendental philosophy,
to which the latter task belongs, is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>other necessary fundamental science of
philosophy.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>II.—COROLLARIES.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In the foregoing we have not only deduced
the idea of transcendental philosophy,
but have also afforded the reader a
glance into the whole system of philosophy,
composed, as has been shown, of two
principal sciences, which, though opposed
in principle and direction, are counter-parts
and complements of each other. Not
the whole system of philosophy, but only
one of the principal sciences of it, is to
be here discussed, and, in the first place,
to be more clearly characterized in accordance
with the idea already deduced.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. If, for transcendental philosophy, the
subjective is the starting point, the only
ground of all reality, and the sole principle
of explanation for everything else, it
necessarily begins with universal doubt
regarding the reality of the objective.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the natural philosopher, wholly intent
upon the objective, seeks, above all
things, to exclude every admixture of the
subjective from his knowledge, so, on the
other hand, the transcendental philosopher
seeks nothing so much as the entire
exclusion of the objective from the purely
subjective principle of knowledge. The
instrument of separation is absolute scepticism—not
that half-scepticism which is
directed merely against the vulgar prejudices
of mankind and never sees the
foundation—but a thorough-going scepticism,
which aims not at individual prejudices,
but at the fundamental prejudice,
with which all others must stand or fall.
For over and above the artificial and conventional
prejudices of man, there are
others of far deeper origin, which have
been placed in him, not by art or education,
but by Nature itself, and which
pass with all other men, except the philosopher,
as the principles of knowledge, and
with the mere self-thinker as the test of
all truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The one fundamental prejudice to which
all others are reducible, is this: that there
are things outside of us; an opinion which,
while it rests neither on proofs nor on conclusions
(for there is not a single irrefragable
proof of it), and yet cannot be uprooted
by any opposite proof (<i>naturam
furcâ expellas, tamen usque redibit</i>), lays
claim to immediate certainty; whereas,
inasmuch as it refers to something quite
different from us—yea, opposed to us—and
of which there is no evidence how it
can come into immediate consciousness, it
must be regarded as nothing more than a
prejudice—a natural and original one, to
be sure, but nevertheless a prejudice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The contradiction lying in the fact that
a conclusion which in its nature cannot
be immediately certain, is, nevertheless,
blindly and without grounds, accepted as
such, cannot be solved by transcendental
philosophy, except on the assumption that
this conclusion is implicitly, and in a
manner hitherto not manifest, not founded
upon, but identical, and one and the
same with an affirmation which is immediately
certain; and to demonstrate this
identity will really be the task of transcendental
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Now, even for the ordinary use of
reason, there is nothing immediately certain
except the affirmation <i>I am</i>, which, as
it loses all meaning outside of immediate
consciousness, is the most individual of
all truths, and the absolute prejudice,
which must be assumed if anything else
is to be made certain. The affirmation
<i>There are things outside of us</i>, will therefore
be certain for the transcendental philosopher,
only through its identity with the
affirmation <i>I am</i>, and its certainty will be
only equal to the certainty of the affirmation
from which it derives it.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to this view, transcendental
knowledge would be distinguished from
ordinary knowledge in two particulars.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First</i>—That for it the certainty of the
existence of external objects is a mere prejudice,
which it oversteps, in order to find
the grounds of it. (It can never be the
business of the transcendental philosopher
to prove the existence of things in themselves,
but only to show that it is a natural
and necessary prejudice to assume external
objects as real.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Second</i>—That the two affirmations, <i>I am</i>
and <i>There are things outside of me</i>, which
in the ordinary consciousness run together,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>are, in the former, separated and the one
placed before the other, with a view to
demonstrate as a fact their identity, and
that immediate connection which in the
other is only felt. By the act of this separation,
when it is complete, the philosopher
transports himself to the transcendental
point of view, which is by no means
a natural, but an artificial one.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. If, for the transcendental philosopher,
the subjective alone has original reality,
he will also make the subjective alone in
knowledge directly his object; the objective
will only become an object indirectly
to him, and, whereas, in ordinary knowledge,
knowledge itself—the act of knowing—vanishes
in the object, in transcendental
knowledge, on the contrary, the
object, as such, will vanish in the act of
knowing. Transcendental knowledge is a
knowledge of knowing, in so far as it is
purely subjective.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, for example, in intuition, it is only
the objective that reaches the ordinary
consciousness; the act of intuition itself
is lost in the object; whereas the transcendental
mode of intuition rather gets
only a glimpse of the object of intuition
through the act. Ordinary thought, therefore,
is a mechanism in which ideas prevail,
without, however, being distinguished
as ideas; whereas transcendental thought
interrupts this mechanism, and in becoming
conscious of the idea as an act, rises
to the idea of the idea. In ordinary action,
the acting itself is forgotten in the
object of the action; philosophizing is
also an action, but not an action only. It
is likewise a continued self-intuition in
this action.</p>

<p class='c006'>The nature of the transcendental mode
of thought consists, therefore, generally
in this: that, in it, that which in all other
thinking, knowing, or acting escapes the
consciousness, and is absolutely non-objective,
is brought into consciousness, and
becomes objective; in short, it consists in
a continuous act of becoming an object to
itself on the part of the subjective.</p>

<p class='c006'>The transcendental art will therefore
consist in a readiness to maintain one’s
self continuously in this duplicity of thinking
and acting.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>III.—PRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENT OF TRANSCENDENTAL PHILOSOPHY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>This arrangement is preliminary, inasmuch
as the principles of arrangement can
be arrived at only in the science itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>We return to the idea of science.</p>

<p class='c006'>Transcendental philosophy has to explain
how knowledge is possible at all,
supposing that the subjective in it is assumed
as the chief or first element.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not, therefore, any single part, or
any particular object of knowledge, but
knowledge itself, and knowledge generally,
that it takes for its object.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now all knowledge is reducible to certain
original convictions or original fore-judgments;
these different convictions
transcendental philosophy must reduce to
one original conviction; this one, from
which all others are derived, is expressed
in the first principle of this philosophy,
and the task of finding such is no other
than that of finding the absolutely certain,
by which all other certainty is arrived at.</p>

<p class='c006'>The arrangement of transcendental philosophy
itself is determined by those original
convictions, whose validity it asserts.
Those convictions must, in the first place,
be sought in the common understanding.
If, therefore, we fall back upon the standpoint
of the ordinary view, we find the
following convictions deeply engraven in
the human understanding:</p>

<p class='c006'>A. That there not only exists outside of
us a world of things independent of us,
but also that our representations agree
with them in such a manner that there is
nothing else in the things beyond what
they present to us. The necessity which
prevails in our objective representations is
explained by saying that the things are
unalterably determined, and that, by this
determination of the things, our ideas
are also indirectly determined. By this
first and most original conviction, the first
problem of the philosophy is determined,
<i>viz.</i>: to explain how representations can
absolutely agree with objects existing altogether
independently of them. Since it is
upon the assumption that things are exactly
as we represent them—that we certainly,
therefore, know things as they are in
themselves—that the possibility of all experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>rests, (for what would experience
be, and where would physics, for example,
wander to, but for the supposition of the
absolute identity of being and seeming?)
the solution of this problem is identical
with theoretical philosophy, which has to
examine the possibility of experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>B. The second equally original conviction
is, that ideas which spring up in us
freely and without necessity are capable
of passing from the world of thought into
the real world, and of arriving at objective
reality.</p>

<p class='c006'>This conviction stands in opposition to
the first. According to the first, it is assumed
that objects are unalterably determined,
and our ideas by them; according
to the other, that objects are alterable,
and that, too, by the causality of ideas in
us. According to the first, there takes
place a transition from the real world into
the world of ideas, or a determining of
ideas by something objective; according
to the second, a transition from the world
of ideas into the real world, or a determining
of the objective by a (freely produced)
idea in us.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this second conviction, a second
problem is determined, <i>viz.</i>: how, by
something merely thought, an objective is
alterable, so as completely to correspond
with that something thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since upon this assumption the possibility
of all free action rests, the solution of
this problem is practical philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>C. But with these two problems we find
ourselves involved in a contradiction. According
to B, there is demanded the dominion
of thought (the ideal) over the
world of sense; but how is this conceivable,
if (according to A) the idea, in its
origin, is already only the slave of the objective?
On the other hand, if the real
world is something quite independent of
us, and in accordance with which, as their
pattern, our ideas must shape themselves
(by A), then it is inconceivable how the
real world, on the other hand, can shape
itself after ideas in us (by B). In a word,
in the theoretical certainty we lose the
practical; in the practical we lose the theoretical.
It is impossible that there
should be at once truth in our knowledge
and reality in our volition.</p>

<p class='c006'>This contradiction must be solved, if
there is to be a philosophy at all; and the
solution of this problem, or the answering
of the question: How can ideas be conceived
as shaping themselves according to
objects, and at the same time objects as
shaping themselves to ideas?—is not the
first, but the highest, task of transcendental
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not difficult to see that this problem
is not to be solved either in theoretical or in
practical philosophy, but in a higher one,
which is the connecting link between the
two, neither theoretical nor practical, but
both at once.</p>

<p class='c006'>How at once the objective world conforms
itself to ideas in us, and ideas in us
conform themselves to the objective world,
it is impossible to conceive, unless there
exists, between the two worlds—the ideal
and the real—a preëstablished harmony.
But this preëstablished harmony itself is
not conceivable, unless the activity,
whereby the objective world is produced,
is originally identical with that which displays
itself in volition, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it is undoubtedly a <i>productive</i> activity
that displays itself in volition; all
free action is productive and productive
only with consciousness. If, then, we
suppose, since the two activities are one
only in their principle, that the same activity
which is productive <i>with</i> consciousness
in free action, is productive <i>without</i>
consciousness in the production of the
world, this preëstablished harmony is a
reality, and the contradiction is solved.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we suppose that all this is really the
case, then that original identity of the activity,
which is busy in the production of
the world, with that which displays itself
in volition, will exhibit itself in the productions
of the former, and these will
necessarily appear as the productions of
an activity at once conscious and unconscious.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nature, as a whole, no less than in its
different productions, will, of necessity,
appear as a work produced with consciousness,
and, at the same time, as a production
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>of the blindest mechanism. It is the
result of purpose, without being demonstrable
as such. The philosophy of the
aims of Nature, or teleology, is therefore
the required point of union between theoretical
and practical philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>D. Hitherto, we have postulated only in
general terms the identity of the unconscious
activity, which has produced Nature,
and the conscious activity, which
exhibits itself in volition, without having
decided where the principle of this activity
lies—whether in Nature or in us.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, the system of knowledge can be
regarded as complete only when it reverts
to its principle. Transcendental philosophy,
therefore, could be complete only
when that identity—the highest solution
of its whole problem—could be demonstrated
in its principle, the <i>Ego</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is therefore postulated that, in the
subjective—in the consciousness itself—that
activity, at once conscious and unconscious,
can be shown.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such an activity can be no other than
the <i>æsthetic</i>, and every work of art can be
conceived only as the product of such.
The ideal work of art and the real world
of objects are therefore products of one
and the same activity; the meeting of the
two (the conscious and the unconscious)
<i>without</i> consciousness, gives the real—<i>with</i>
consciousness, the æsthetic world.</p>

<p class='c006'>The objective world is only the primal,
still unconscious, poetry of the mind; the
universal <i>organum</i> of philosophy, the key-stone
of its whole arch, is the philosophy
of art.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IV.—ORGAN OF TRANSCENDENTAL PHILOSOPHY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. The only immediate object of transcendental
consideration is the subjective
(II.); the only organ for philosophizing
in this manner is the <i>inner sense</i>, and its
object is such that, unlike that of mathematics,
it can never become the object of
external intuition. The object of mathematics,
to be sure, exists as little outside
of knowledge, as that of philosophy. The
whole existence of mathematics rests on
intuition; it exists, therefore, only in intuition;
and this intuition itself is an external
one. In addition to this, the mathematician
never has to deal immediately
with the intuition—the construction itself—but
only with the thing constructed, which,
of course, can be exhibited outwardly;
whereas the philosopher looks only at the
act of construction itself, which is purely
an internal one.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Moreover, the objects of the transcendental
philosopher have no existence,
except in so far as they are freely produced.
Nothing can compel to this production,
any more than the external describing
of a figure can compel one to
regard it internally. Just as the existence
of a mathematical figure rests on the outer
sense, so the whole reality of a philosophical
idea rests upon the inner sense.
The whole object of this philosophy is no
other than the action of Intelligence according
to fixed laws. This action can be
conceived only by means of a peculiar,
direct, inner intuition, and this again is
possible only by production. But this is
not enough. In philosophizing, one is not
only the object considered, but always at the
same time the subject considering. To the
understanding of philosophy, therefore,
there are two conditions indispensable:
first, that the philosopher shall be engaged
in a continuous internal activity, in a continuous
production of those primal actions
of the intelligence; second, that he shall
be engaged in continuous reflection upon
the productive action;—in a word, that he
shall be at once the contemplated (producing)
and the contemplating.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. By this continuous duplicity of production
and intuition, that must become
an object which is otherwise reflected by
nothing. It cannot be shown here, but
will be shown in the sequel, that this
becoming-reflected on the part of the
absolutely unconscious and non-objective,
is possible only by an æsthetic act of the
imagination. Meanwhile, so much is plain
from what has already been proved, that
all philosophy is productive. Philosophy,
therefore, no less than art, rests upon the
productive faculty, and the difference between
the two, upon the different direction
of the productive power. For whereas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>production in art is directed outward, in
order to reflect the unconscious by products,
philosophical production is directed
immediately inward, in order to reflect it
in intellectual intuition. The real sense
by which this kind of philosophy must be
grasped, is therefore the æsthetic sense,
and hence it is that the philosophy of art
is the true organum of philosophy (III.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Out of the vulgar reality there are only
two means of exit—poetry, which transports
us into an ideal world, and philosophy,
which makes the real world vanish
before us. It is not plain why the sense
for philosophy should be more generally
diffused than that for poetry, especially
among that class of men, who, whether by
memory-work (nothing destroys more directly
the productive) or by dead speculation
(ruinous to all imaginative power),
have completely lost the æsthetic organ.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. It is unnecessary to occupy time with
common-places about the sense of truth,
and about utter unconcern in regard to
results, although it might be asked, what
other conviction can yet be sacred to him
who lays hands upon the most certain of
all—that there are things outside of us?
We may rather take one glance more at the
so-called claims of the common understanding.</p>

<p class='c006'>The common understanding in matters
of philosophy has no claims whatsoever,
except those which every object of examination
has, <i>viz.</i>, to be completely explained.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not, therefore, any part of our business
to prove that what it considers true,
is true, but only to exhibit the unavoidable
character of its illusions. This implies
that the objective world belongs only to
the necessary limitations which render
self-consciousness (which is I) possible;
it is enough for the common understanding,
if from this view again the necessity
of its view is derived.</p>

<p class='c006'>For this purpose it is necessary, not only
that the inner works of the mental activity
should be laid open, and the mechanism of
necessary ideas revealed, but also that it
should be shown by what peculiarity of
our nature it is, that what has reality only
in our intuition, is reflected to us as something
existing outside of us.</p>

<p class='c006'>As natural science produces idealism
out of realism, by mentalizing the laws of
Nature into laws of intelligence, or super-inducing
the formal upon the material
(I.), so transcendental philosophy produces
realism out of idealism, by materializing
the laws of Nature, or introducing
the material into the formal.</p>

human soul is that in and by which the Good in the world is consummated.”—<span class='sc'>Plato.</span></p>
<h4 class='c012'>I.—VESTIGES.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Behmen, the subtilest thinker on Genesis
since Plato, conceives that Nature fell from
its original oneness by fault of Lucifer
before man rose physically from its ruins;
and moreover, that his present existence,
being the struggle to recover from Nature’s
lapse, is embarrassed with double difficulties
by deflection from rectitude on his
part. We think it needs no Lucifer other
than mankind collectively conspiring, to
account for Nature’s mishaps, or Man’s.
Since, assuming man to be Nature’s ancestor,
and Nature man’s ruins rather, himself
is the impediment he seeks to remove;
and, moreover, conceiving Nature as corresponding
in large—or macrocosmically—to
his intents, for whatsoever embarrassments
he finds therein, himself, and none
other, takes the blame. Eldest of creatures,
and progenitor of all below him,
personally one and imperishable in essence,
it follows that if debased forms appear in
Nature, it must be consequent on Man’s degeneracy
prior to their genesis. And it is
only as he lapses out of his integrity, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>debasing his essence, that he impairs his
original likeness, and drags it into the
prone shapes of the animal kingdom—these
being the effigies and vestiges of his individualized
and shattered personality. Behold
these upstarts of his loins, everywhere
the mimics jeering at him saucily,
or gaily parodying their fallen lord.</p>

things.”—<i>St. Augustine.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>Better is he who is above temptation
than he who, being tempted, overcomes;
since the latter but suppresses the evil inclination
in his breast, which the former
has not. Whoever is tempted has so far
sinned as to entertain the tempting lust
stirring within him, and betraying his
lapse from singleness or holiness. The
virtuous choose, and are virtuous by choice;
while the holy, being one, are above all
need of deliberating, their volitions answering
spontaneously to their desires. It
is the cleft personality, or <i>other</i> within, that
confronts and seduces the Will; the Adversary
and Deuce we become individually,
and thus impersonate in the Snake.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c012'>III.—SERPENT SYMBOL.</h4>
<p class='c005'>One were an Œdipus to expound this
serpent mythology; yet failing this, were
to miss finding the keys to the mysteries
of Genesis, and Nature were the chaos and
abyss; since hereby the one rejoins man’s
parted personality, and recreates lost mankind.
Coeval with flesh, the symbol appears
wherever traces of civilization exist,
a remnant of it in the ancient Phallus worship
having come to us disguised in our
May-day dance. Nor was it confined to
carnal knowledge merely. The serpent
symbolized divine wisdom, also; and it
was under this acceptation that it became
associated with those “traditionary teachers
of mankind whose genial wisdom entitled
them to divine honors.” An early
Christian sect, called Ophites, worshipped
it as the personation of natural knowledge.
So the injunction, “Be ye wise as serpents
and harmless as doves,” becomes the more
significant when we learn that <i>seraph</i> in
the original means a serpent; <i>cherub</i>, a
dove; these again symbolizing facts in
osteological science as connected with the
latest theories of the invertebrated cranium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>accepted by eminent naturalists, and
so substantiating the symbol in nature;
this being ophiomorphous, a series of
spires, crowned, winged, webbed, finned,
footed in structure, set erect, prone, trailing,
as charged with life in higher potency
or lower; man, supreme in personal uprightness,
and holding the sceptre of dominion
as he maintains his inborn rectitude,
or losing his prerogative as he lapses
from his integrity, thus debasing his form
and parcelling his gifts away in the prone
shapes distributed throughout Nature’s
kingdoms; or, again, aspiring for lost supremacy,
he uplifts and crowns his fallen
form with forehead, countenance, speech,
thereby liberating the genius from the
slime of its prone periods, and restoring
it to rectitude, religion, science, fellowship,
the ideal arts.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“The form is in the archetype before it appears
in the work, in the divine mind before
it exists in the creature.”—<i>Leibnitz.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>As the male impregnates the female, so
mind charges matter with form and fecundity;
the spermatic world being life in
transmission and body in embryo. So the
egg is a genesis and seminary of forms,
(the kingdoms of animated nature sleeping
coiled in its yolk) and awaits the quickening
magnetism that ushers them into light.
Herein the human embryon unfolds in
series the lineaments of all forms in the
living hierarchy, to be fixed at last in its
microcosm, unreeling therefrom its faculties
into filamental organs, spinning so
minutely the threads, “that were it physically
possible to dissolve away all other
members of the body, there would still remain
the full and perfect figure of a man.
And it is this perfect cerebro-spinal axis,
this statue-like tissue of filaments, that,
physically speaking, is the man.“ The
mind above contains him spiritually, and
reveals him physically to himself and his
kind. Every creature assists in its own
formation, souls being essentially creative
and craving form.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For the creature delights in the image
of the Creator; and the soul of man will
in a manner clasp God to herself. Having
nothing mortal, she is wholly inebriated

A quickening spirit and mediator

with all souls, with the Soul of souls, in
generating the substance in which he immerses
his form, and wherein he embosoms
his essence. Not elemental, but fundamental,
essential, he generates elements
and forces, expiring while consuming, and
perpetually replenishing his waste; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>final conflagration a current fact of his existence.
Does the assertion seem incredible,
absurd? But science, grown luminous
and transcendent, boldly declares
that life to the senses is ablaze, refeeding
steadily its flame from the atmosphere it
kindles into life, its embers the spent remains

materialist, in his mania for matter on the one
hand and dread of ideas on the other, to invert
nature’s order, and thus hang the world’s picture
as a man with his heels upwards.”—<i>Cudworth.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>This inverse order of thought conducts
of necessity to conclusions as derogatory
to himself as to Nature’s author. Assuming
matter as his basis of investigation, force
as father of thought, he confounds faculties
with organs, life with brute substance,
and must needs pile his atom atop of atom,
cement cell on cell, in constructing his
column, sconce mounting sconce aspiringly
as it rises, till his shaft of gifts crown itself
surreptitiously with the ape’s glorified
effigy, as Nature’s frontispiece and head.
Life’s atomy with life omitted altogether,
man wanting. Not thus reads the ideal
naturalist the Book of lives. But opening
at spirit, and thence proceeding to ideas
and finding their types in matter, life unfolds
itself naturally in organs, faculties
begetting forces, mind moulding things
substantially, its connections and inter-dependencies
appear in series and degrees
as he traces the leaves, thought the key to
originals, man the connexus, archetype,
and classifier of things; he, straightway,
leading forth abreast of himself the animated
creation from the chaos,—the primeval
Adam naming his mates, himself their
ancestor, contemporary and survivor.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>VII.—DIALOGIC.</h4>
<p class='c005'>If the age of iron and brass be hard upon
us, fast welding its fetters and chains
about our foreheads and limbs, here, too, is
the Promethean fire of thought to liberate
letters, science, art, philosophy, using the
new agencies let loose by the Dædalus of
mechanic invention and discovery, in the
service of the soul, as of the senses. Having
recovered the omnipresence in nature,
graded space, tunnelled the abyss, joined
ocean and land by living wires, stolen the
chemistry of atom and solar ray, made
light our painter, the lightning our runner,
thought is pushing its inquiries into the
unexplored regions of man’s personality,
for whose survey and service every modern
instrument lends the outlay and means—facilities
ample and unprecedented—new
instruments for the new discoverers. Using
no longer contentedly the eyes of a toiling
circuitous logic, the genius takes the track
of the creative thought, intuitively, cosmically,
ontologically. A subtler analysis is
finely disseminated, a broader synthesis
accurately generalized from the materials
accumulated on the mind during the centuries,
the globe’s contents being gathered
in from all quarters: the book of creation,
newly illustrated and posted to date. The
new Calculus is ours: an organon alike
serviceable to naturalist and metaphysician:
a Dialogic for resolving things into
thoughts, matter into mind, power into
personality, man into God, many into one;
soul in souls seen as the creative controlling
spirit, pulsating in all bodies, inspiring,
animating, organizing, immanent in
the atoms, circulating at centre and circumference,
willing in all wills, personally
embosoming all persons an unbroken
synthesis of Being.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>ANALYSIS OF HEGEL’S ÆSTHETICS. <br /> Translated from the French of <span class='sc'>Ch. Benard</span>, by <span class='sc'>J. A. Martling</span>.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c012'>Part III. <br /> System of the Particular Arts.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Under the head of “System of the Particular
Arts,” Hegel sets forth, in this
third part, the theory of each of the arts—<i>Architecture</i>,
<i>Sculpture</i>, <i>Painting</i>, <i>Music</i>
and <i>Poetry</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before proceeding to the division of the
arts, he glances at the different <i>styles</i>
which distinguish the different epochs of
their development. He reduces them to
three styles: the <i>simple</i> or severe, the
<i>ideal</i> or beautiful, and the graceful.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. At first the simple and natural style
presents itself to us, but it is not the
truly natural or true simplicity. That
supposes a previous perfection. Primitive
simplicity is gross, confused, rigid,
inanimate. Art in its infancy is heavy
and trifling, destitute of life and liberty,
without expression, or with an exaggerated
vivacity. Still harsh and rude in its
commencements, it becomes by degrees
master of form, and learns to unite it
intimately with content. It arrives thus at
a severe beauty. This style is the Beautiful
in its lofty simplicity. It is restricted
to reproducing a subject with its essential
traits. Disdaining grace and ornament, it
contents itself with the general and grand
expression which springs from the subject,
without the artist’s exhibiting himself and
revealing his personality in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Next in order comes the beautiful
style, the <i>ideal</i> and pure style, which
holds the mean between simple expression
and a marked tendency to the graceful.
Its character is vitality, combined with a
calm and beautiful grandeur. Grace is
not wanting, but there is rather a natural
carelessness, a simple complacency, than
the desire to please—a beauty indifferent
to the exterior charms which blossom of
themselves upon the surface. Such is the
ideal of the beautiful style—the style of
Phidias and Homer. It is the culminating
point of art.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. But this movement is short. The
ideal style passes quickly to the graceful,
to the agreeable. Here appears an aim
different from that of the realization of
the beautiful, which pure art ought to
propose to itself, to wit: the intention of
pleasing, of producing an impression on
the soul. Hence arise works of a style
elaborate with art, and a certain seeking
for external embellishments. The subject
is no more the principal thing. The attention
of the artist is distracted by ornaments
and accessories—by the decorations,
the trimmings, the simpering airs, the attitudes
and graceful postures, or the vivid
colors and the attractive forms, the luxury
of ornaments and draperies, the learned
making of verse. But the general effect
remains without grandeur and without nobleness.
Beautiful proportions and grand
masses give place to moderate dimensions,
or are masked with ornaments. The
graceful style begets the style <i>for effect</i>,
which is an exaggeration of it. The art
then becomes altogether conspicuous; it
calls the attention of the spectator by
everything that can strike the senses. The
artist surrenders to it his personal ends
and his design. In this species of <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with the public, there is betrayed
through all, the desire of exhibiting his
wit, of attracting admiration for his ability,
his skill, his power of execution.
This art—without naturalness, full of coquetry,
of artifice and affectation, the opposite
of the severe style which yields
nothing to the public—is the style of the
epochs of decadence. Frequently it has
recourse to a last artifice, to the affectation
of profundity and of simplicity,
which is then only obscurity, a mysterious
profundity which conceals an absence of
ideas and a real impotence. This air of
mystery, which parades itself, is in its
turn, hardly better than coquetry; the
principle is the same—the desire of producing
an effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>The author then passes to the <i>Division
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of the Arts</i>. The common method classes
them according to their means of representation,
and the senses to which they
are addressed. Two senses only are affected
by the perception of the beautiful:
<i>sight</i>, which perceives forms and colors,
and <i>hearing</i>, which perceives sounds.
Hence the division into <i>arts of design</i> and
<i>musical art</i>. <i>Poetry</i>, which employs
speech, and addresses itself to the imagination,
forms a domain apart. Without
discarding this division, Hegel combines
it with another more philosophical principle
of classification, and one which is
taken no longer from the external means
of art, but from their internal relation to
the very content of the ideas which it is
to represent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Art has for object the representation of
the ideal. The arts ought then to be
classed according to the measure in which
they are more or less capable of expressing
it. This gradation will have at the
same time the advantage of corresponding
to historic progress, and to the fundamental
forms of art previously studied.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to this principle, the arts
marshal themselves, and succeed one
another, to form a regular and complete
system, thus:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. First <i>Architecture</i> presents itself.
This art, in fact, is incapable of representing
an idea otherwise than in a vague,
indeterminate manner. It fashions the
masses of inorganic nature, according to
the laws of matter and geometrical proportions;
it disposes them with regularity
and symmetry in such a manner as to
offer to the eyes an image which is a simple
reflex of the spirit, a dumb symbol of
the thought. Architecture is at the same
time appropriated to ends which are foreign
to it: it is destined to furnish a
dwelling for man and a temple for Divinity;
it must shelter under its roof, in its
enclosure, the other arts, and, in particular,
sculpture and painting.</p>

<p class='c006'>For these reasons architecture should,
historically and logically, be placed first
in the series of the arts.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. In a higher rank is Sculpture, which
already exhibits spirit under certain determinate
traits. Its object, in fact, is
spirit individualized, revealed by the human
form and its living organism. Under
this visible appearance, by the features of
the countenance, and the proportions of
the body, it expresses ideal beauty, divine
calmness, serenity—in a word, the classic
ideal.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Although retained in the world of
visible forms, Painting offers a higher degree
of spirituality. To form, it adds the
different phases of visible appearance,
the illusions of perspective, color, light
and shades, and thereby it becomes capable,
not only of reproducing the various
pictures of nature, but also of expressing
upon canvas the most profound sentiments
of the human soul, and all the scenes of
ethical life.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. But, as an expression of sentiment,
<i>Music</i> still surpasses painting. What it
expresses is the soul itself, in its most intimate
and profound relations; and this
by a sensuous phenomenon, equally invisible,
instantaneous, intangible—sound—sonorous
vibrations, which resound in the
abysses of the soul, and agitate it
throughout.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. All these arts culminate in Poetry,
which includes them and surpasses them,
and whose superiority is due to its mode
of expression—<i>speech</i>. It alone is capable
of expressing all ideas, all sentiments,
all passions, the highest conceptions of
the intelligence, and the most fugitive
impressions of the soul. To it alone is
given to represent an action in its complete
development and in all its phases.
It is the universal art—its domain is unlimited.
Hence it is divided into many
species, of which the principal are <i>epic</i>,
<i>lyric</i> and <i>dramatic</i> poetry.</p>

<p class='c006'>These five arts form the complete and
organized system of the arts. Others,
such as the <i>art of gardening, dancing, engraving,
etc.</i>, are only accessories, and
more or less connected with the preceding.
They have not the right to occupy a
distinct place in a general theory; they
would only introduce confusion, and disfigure
the fundamental type which is peculiar
to each of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the division adopted by Hegel.
He combines it, at the same time, with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>general division of the forms of the historic
development of art. Thus architecture
appears to him to correspond more
particularly to the <i>symbolic</i> type; sculpture
is the <i>classic</i> art, <i>par excellence</i>;
painting and music fill the category of the
<i>romantic</i> arts. Poetry, as art universal,
belongs to all epochs.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. <span class='sc'>Architecture.</span>—In the study of architecture,
Hegel follows a purely historic
method. He limits himself to describing
and characterizing its principal forms in
the different epochs of history. This art,
in fact, lends itself to an abstract theory
less than the others. There are here few
principles to establish; and when we depart
from generalities, we enter into the
domain of mathematical laws, or into the
technical applications, foreign to pure
science. It remains, then, only to determine
the sense and the character of its
monuments, in their relation to the spirit
of the people, and the epochs to which
they belong. It is to this point of view
that the author has devoted himself. The
division which he adopts on this subject,
and the manner in which he explains it,
are as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>The object of architecture, independent
of the positive design and the use to
which its monuments are appropriated, is
to express a general thought, by forms
borrowed from inorganic nature, by masses
fashioned and disposed according to the
laws of geometry and mechanics. But
whatever may be the ideas and the impressions
which the appearance of an edifice
produces, it never furnishes other than
an obscure and enigmatic emblem. The
thought is vaguely represented by those
material forms which spirit itself does not
animate.</p>

<p class='c006'>If such is the nature of this art, it follows
that, essentially symbolic, it must
predominate in that first epoch of history
which is distinguished by the symbolic
character of its monuments. It must show
itself there freer, more independent of
practical utility, not subordinated to a
foreign end. Its essential object ought to
be to express ideas, to present emblems, to
symbolize the beliefs of those peoples, incapable
as they are of otherwise expressing
them. It is the proper language of
such an epoch—a language enigmatic and
mysterious; it indicates the effort of the
imagination to represent ideas, still vague.
Its monuments are problems proposed to
future ages, and which as yet are but imperfectly
comprehended.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the character of oriental architecture.
There the end is valueless or accessory;
the symbolic expression is the
principal object. Architecture is <i>independent</i>,
and sculpture is confounded with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The monuments of Greek and Roman
architecture present a wholly different
character. Here, the aim of utility appears
clearly distinct from expression.
The purpose, the design of the monument
comes out in an evident manner. It is a
dwelling, a shelter, a temple, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sculpture, for its part, is detached from
architecture, and assigns its end to it.
The image of the god, enclosed in the
temple, is the principal object. The temple
is only a shelter, an external attendant.
Its forms are regulated according to the
laws of numbers, and the proportions of a
learned eurythmy; but its true ornaments
are furnished to it by sculpture.
Architecture ceases then to be independent
and symbolic; it becomes dependent,
subordinated to a positive end.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to Christian architecture or that of
the Middle Ages, it presents the union of
the two preceding characteristics. It is at
once devoted to a useful end, and eminently
expressive or symbolic—<i>dependent</i>
and <i>independent</i>. The temple is the house
of God; it is devoted to the uses and ceremonies
of worship, and shows throughout
its design in its forms; but at the same
time these symbolize admirably the Christian
idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the symbolic, classic and romantic
forms, borrowed from history, and which
mark the whole development of art, serve
for the division and classification of the
forms of architecture. This being especially
the art which is exercised in the domain
of matter, the essential point to be
distinguished is whether the monument
which is addressed to the eyes includes in
itself its own meaning, or whether it is
considered as a means to a foreign end,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>or finally whether, although in the service
of a foreign end, it preserves its independence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>basis</i> of the division being thus
placed, Hegel justifies it by describing the
characters of the monuments belonging to
these three epochs. All this descriptive
part can not be analyzed: we are obliged
to limit ourselves to securing a comprehension
of the general features, and to noting
the most remarkable points.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>a</i>) Since the distinctive characteristic of
symbolic architecture is the expression of
a general thought, without other end than
the representation of it, the interest in its
monuments is less in their positive design
than in the religious conceptions of the
people, who, not having other means of
expression, have embodied their thought,
still vague and confused, in these gigantic
masses and these colossal images. Entire
nations know not how otherwise to express
their religious beliefs. Hence the symbolic
character of the structures of the
Babylonians, the Indians and the Egyptians,
of those works which absorbed the
life of those peoples, and whose meaning
we seek to explain to ourselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is difficult to follow a regular order in
the absence of chronology, when we review
the multiplicity of ideas and forms
which these monuments and these symbols
present. Hegel thinks, nevertheless, that
he is able to establish the following gradations:</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first rank are the simplest monuments,
such as seem only designed to serve
as a bond of union to entire nations, or to
different nations. Such gigantic structures
as the tower of Belus or Babylon, upon
the shores of the Euphrates, present the
image of the union of the peoples before
their dispersion. Community of toil and
effort is the aim and the very idea of the
work; it is the common work of their
united efforts, the symbol of the dissolution
of the primitive family and of the
formation of a vaster society.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a rank more elevated, appear the monuments
of a more determined character,
where is noticeable a mingling of architecture
and sculpture, although they belong
to the former. Such are those symbols
which, in the East, represent the
generative force of nature; the <i>phallus</i>
and the <i>lingam</i> scattered in so great numbers
throughout Phrygia and Syria, and
of which India is the principal seat; in
Egypt, the obelisks, which derive their
symbolic significance from the rays of the
sun; the Memnons, colossal statues which
also represent the sun and his beneficent
influence upon nature; the sphinxes,
which one finds in Egypt in prodigious
numbers and of astonishing size, ranged
in rows in the form of avenues. These
monuments, of an imposing sculpture, are
grouped in masses, surrounded by walls
so as to form buildings.</p>

<p class='c006'>They present, in a striking manner, the
twofold character indicated above: free
from all positive design, they are, above
all, symbols; afterward, sculpture is confounded
with architecture. They are
structures without roof, without doors,
without aisles, frequently forests of colums
where the eye loses itself. The eye
passes over objects which are there for
their own sake, designed only to strike the
imagination by their colossal aspect and
their enigmatic sense, not to serve as a
dwelling for a god, and as a place of assemblage
for his worshippers. Their order
and their disposition alone preserve for
them an architectural character. You walk
on into the midst of those human works,
mute symbols which remind you of divine
things; your eyes are everywhere struck
with the aspect of those forms and those
extraordinary figures, of those walls besprinkled
with hieroglyphics, books of
stone, as it were, leaves of a mysterious
book. Everything there is symbolically determined—the
proportions, the distances,
the number of columns, etc. The Egyptians,
in particular, consecrated their lives
to constructing and building these monuments,
by instinct, as a swarm of bees
builds its hive. This was the whole life of
the people. It placed there all its thought,
for it could no otherwise express it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, that architecture, in one
point, by its chambers and its halls, its
tombs, begins to approach the following
class, which exhibits a more positive design,
and of which the type is a house.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>A third rank marks the transition of
symbolic to classic architecture. Architecture
already presents a character of
utility, of conformity to an end. The
monument has a precise design; it serves
for a particular use taken aside from the
symbolic sense. It is a temple or a tomb.
Such, in the first place, is the subterranean
architecture of the Indians, those vast excavations
which are also temples, species
of subterranean cathedrals, the caverns of
Mithra, likewise filled with symbolic sculpture.
But this transition is better characterized
by the double architecture, (subterranean
and above ground) of the Egyptians,
which is connected with their worship
of the dead. An individual being, who
has his significance and his proper value;
the dead one, distinct from his habitation
which serves him only for covering and
shelter, resides in the interior. The most
ancient of these tombs are the pyramids,
species of crystals, envelopes of stone
which enclose a kernel, an invisible being,
and which serve for the preservation of the
bodies. In this concealed dead one, resides
the significance of the <i>monument</i> which is
subordinate to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here, then, <i>Architecture</i> ceases to be independent.
It divides itself into two elements—the
end and the means; it is the
means, and it is subservient to an end.
Further, sculpture separates itself from it,
and obtains a distinct office—that of shaping
the image within, and its accessories.
Here appears clearly the special design of
architecture, conformity to an end; also
it assumes inorganic and geometric forms,
the abstract, mathematical form, which
befits it in particular. The pyramid already
exhibits the design of a house, the
rectangular form.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b</i>) Classic architecture has a two-fold
point of departure—symbolic architecture
and necessity. The adaptation of parts to
an end, in symbolic architecture, is accessory.
In the house, on the contrary, all
is controlled, from the first, by actual necessity
and convenience. Now classic
architecture proceeds both from the one
and from the other principle, from necessity
and from art, from the useful and
from the beautiful, which it combines in
the most perfect manner. Necessity produces
regular forms, right angles, plane
surfaces. But the end is not simply the
satisfaction of a physical necessity; there
is also an idea, a religious representation,
a sacred image, which it has to shelter
and surround, a worship, a religious ceremonial.
The temple ought then, like the
temple fashioned by sculpture, to spring
from the creative imagination of the artist.
There is necessary a dwelling for the god,
fashioned by art and according to its laws.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, while falling under the law of
conformity to an end, and ceasing to be
independent, architecture escapes from
the useful and submits to the law of the
beautiful; or rather, the beautiful and
useful meet and combine themselves in the
happiest manner. Symmetry, eurythmy,
organic forms the most graceful, the most
rich, and the most varied, join themselves
as ornaments to the architectural forms.
The two points of view are united without
being confounded, and form an harmonious
whole; there will be, at the same time,
a useful, convenient and beautiful architecture.</p>

<p class='c006'>What best marks the transition to Greek
architecture, is the appearance of the column,
which is its type. The column is a
support. Therein is its useful and mechanical
design; it fulfils that design in the
most simple and perfect manner, because
with it the power of support is reduced to
its minimum of material means. From
another side, in order to be adapted to its
end and to beauty, it must give up its
natural and primitive form. The beautiful
column comes from a form borrowed
from nature; but carved, shaped, it takes a
regular and geometric configuration. In
Egypt, human figures serve as columns;
here they are replaced by caryatides. But
the natural, primitive form is the tree, the
trunk, the flexible stock, which bears its
crown. Such, too, appears the Egyptian
column; columns are seen rising from the
vegetable kingdom in the stalks of the
lotus and other trees; the base resembles
an onion. The leaf shoots from the root,
like that of a reed, and the capital presents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the appearance of a flower. The
mathematical and regular form is absent.
In the Greek column, on the contrary, all
is fashioned according to the mathematical
laws of regularity and proportion. The
beautiful column springs from a form borrowed
from nature, but fashioned according
to the artistic sense.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the characteristic of classic architecture,
as of architecture in general, is
the union of beauty and utility. Its beauty
consists in its regularity, and although it
serves a foreign end, it constitutes a whole
perfect in itself; it permits its essential
aim to look forth in all its parts, and
through the harmony of its relations, it
transforms the useful into the beautiful.</p>

<p class='c006'>The character of classic architecture being
subordination to an end, it is that
end which, without detriment to beauty,
gives to the entire edifice its proper signification,
and which becomes thus the principal
regulator of all its parts; as it impresses
itself on the whole, and determines
its fundamental form. The first thing
as to a work of this sort, then, is to know
what is its purpose, its design. The general
purpose of a Grecian temple is to hold
the statue of a god. But in its exterior,
the character of the temple relates to a
different end, and its spirit is the life of
the Greek people.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the Greeks, open structures, colonnades
and porticoes, have as object the
promenade in the open air, conversation,
public life under a pure sky. Likewise
the dwellings of private persons are insignificant.
Among the Romans, on the contrary,
whose national architecture has a
more positive end in utility, appears later
the luxury of private houses, palaces,
villas, theatres, circuses, amphitheatres,
aqueducts and fountains. But the principal
edifice is that whose end is most remote
from the wants of material life; it
is the temple designed to serve as a shelter
to a divine object, which already belongs
to the fine arts—to the statue of a
god.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although devoted to a determinate end,
this architecture is none the less free from
it, in the sense, that it disengages itself
from organic forms; it is more free even
than sculpture, which is obliged to reproduce
them; it invents its plan, the general
configuration, and it displays in external
forms all the richness of the imagination;
it has no other laws than those of good
taste and harmony; it labors without a
direct model. Nevertheless, it works
within a limited domain, that of mathematical
figures, and it is subjected to the
laws of mechanics. Here must be preserved,
first of all, the relations between
the width, the length, the height of the
edifice; the exact proportions of the columns
according to their thickness, the
weight to be supported, the intervals, the
number of columns, the style, the simplicity
of the ornaments. It is this which
gives to the theory of this art, and in particular
of this form of architecture, the
character of dryness and abstraction. But
there dominates throughout, a natural
eurythmy, which their perfectly accurate
sense enabled the Greeks to find and fix
as the measure and rule of the beautiful.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will not follow the author in the description
which he gives of the particular
characteristics of architectural forms; we
will omit also some other interesting details
upon building in wood or in stone as
the primitive type, upon the relation of
the different parts of the Greek temple.
In here following Vitruvius, the author
has been able to add some discriminating
and judicious remarks. What he says, in
particular, of the column, of its proportions
and of its design, of the internal
unity of the different parts and of their
effects as a whole, adds to what is already
known a philosophical explication which
satisfies the reason. We remark, especially,
this passage, which sums up the general
character of the Greek temple: “In
general, the Greek temple presents an aspect
which satisfies the vision, and, so to
speak, surfeits it. Nothing is very elevated,
it is regularly extended in length
and breadth. The eye finds itself allured
by the sense of extent, while Gothic architecture
mounts even beyond measurement,
and shoots upward to heaven. Besides, the
ornaments are so managed that they do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>not mar the general expression of simplicity.
In this, the ancients observe the
most beautiful moderation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The connection of their architecture
with the genius, the spirit, and the life of
the Greek people, is indicated in the following
passage: “In place of the spectacle
of an assemblage united for a single
end, all appears directed towards the exterior,
and presents us the image of an
animated promenade. There men who have
leisure abandon themselves to conversations
without end, wherein rule gayety and
serenity. The whole expression of such a
temple remains truly simple and grand in
itself, but it has at the same time an air
of serenity, something open and graceful.”
This prepares and conducts us to another
kind of architecture, which presents a
striking contrast to the preceding Christian
or Gothic architecture.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c</i>) We shall not further attempt to reproduce,
even in its principal features, the
description which Hegel gives, in some
pages, of Romantic or Gothic architecture.
The author has proposed to himself, as
object, in the first place, to compare the
two kinds of architecture, the Greek and
the Christian, then to secure the apprehension
of the relation of this form of architecture
to the Christian idea. This is
what constitutes the peculiar interest of
this remarkable sketch, which, by its vigor
and severity of design, preserves its distinctive
merit when compared with all descriptions
that have been made of the
architecture of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Gothic</i> architecture, according to Hegel,
unites, in the first place, the opposite characters
of the two preceding kinds. Notwithstanding,
this union does not consist
in the simple fusion of the architectural
forms of the East and of Greece. Here,
still more than in the Greek temple, the
house furnishes the fundamental type. An
architectural edifice which is the house of
God, shows itself perfectly in conformity
with its design and adapted to worship;
but the monument is also there for its own
sake, independent, absolute. Externally,
the edifice ascends, shoots freely into the
air.</p>

<p class='c006'>The conformity to the end, although it
presents itself to the eyes, is therefore
effaced, and leaves to the whole the appearance
of an independent existence. The
monument has a determinate sense, and
shows it; but, in its grand aspect and its
sublime calm, it is lifted above all end in
utility, to something infinite in itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we examine the relation of this architecture
to the inner spirit and the idea of
Christian worship, we remark, in the first
place, that the fundamental form is here
the house wholly closed. Just as, in fact,
the Christian spirit withdraws itself into
the interior of the conscience, just so the
church is an enclosure, sealed on all sides,
the place of meditation and silence. “It
is the place of the reflection of the soul
into itself, which thus shuts itself up materially
in space. On the other hand, if,
in Christian meditation, the soul withdraws
into itself, it is, at the same time,
lifted above the finite, and this equally
determines the character of the house
of God. Architecture takes, then, for
its independent signification, elevation
towards the infinite, a character which
it expresses by the proportions of its
architectural forms.” These two traits,
depth of self-examination and elevation
of the soul towards the infinite, explain
completely the Gothic architecture and its
principal forms. They furnish also the
essential differences between Gothic and
Greek architecture.</p>

<p class='c006'>The impression which the Christian
church ought to produce in contrast with
this open and serene aspect of the Greek
temple, is, in the first place, the calmness
of the soul which reflects into itself, then
that of a sublime majesty which shoots
beyond the confines of sense. Greek edifices
extend horizontally; the Christian
church should lift itself from the ground
and shoot into the air.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most striking characteristic which
the house of God presents, in its whole
and its parts, is, then, the free flight, the
shooting in points formed either by broken
arches or by right lines. In Greek architecture,
exact proportion between support
and height is everywhere observed. Here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>on the contrary, the operation of supporting
and the disposition at a right angle—the
most convenient for this end—disappears
or is effaced. The walls and the
column shoot without marked difference
between what supports and what is supported,
and meet in an acute angle. Hence
the acute triangle and the ogee, which
form the characteristic traits of Gothic
architecture.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are not able to follow the author in
the detailed explication of the different
forms and the divers parts of the Gothic
edifice, and of its total structure.</p>

gigantic strides. Since the imposing fabric
of the Hegelian philosophy proved but
a house built on sands, the scales and metre
have become our only gods.</p>

<p class='c006'>Germany—mystic, metaphysical Germany—strange
to say, leads the van in
this crusade against all faith and all idealism.
Vogt, the geologist, Moleschott, the
physiologist, Virchow, the greatest of all
living histologists, Büchner, Tiedemann,
Reuchlin, Meldeg, and many others, not
only hold these opinions, but have left the
seclusion of the laboratory and the clinic
to enter the arena of polemics in their favor.
We do not mention the French and
English advocates of “positive philosophy.”
Their name is Legion.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not our design to enter at all at
large into these views, still less to dispute
them, but merely to give the latest and
most approved defence of a single point
of their position, a point which we
submit is the kernel of the whole controversy,
and which we believe to be the
very Achilles heel and crack in the armor
of their panoply of argument—that is,
the <i>Theory of the Absolute</i>. Demonstrate
the possibility of the Absolute, and materialism
is impossible; disprove it, and
all other philosophies are empty nothings,—<i>vox
et præterea nihil</i>. Here, and
only here, is materialism brought face
to face with metaphysics; here is the
combat <i>à l’outrance</i> in which one or the
other must perish. No one of its apostles
has accepted the proffered glaive more
heartily, and defended his position with
more wary dexterity, than Moleschott, and
it is mainly from his work, entitled <i>Der
Kreislauf des Lebens</i>, that we illustrate
the present metaphysics of materialism.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our first question is, What is the test of
truth, what sanctions a law? Until this
is answered, all assertion is absurd, and
until it is answered correctly, all philosophy
is vain. The response of the naturalist
is: “The necessary sequence of cause
and effect is the prime law of the experimentalist—a
law which he does not ask
from revelation, but will find out for himself
by observation.” The source of truth
is sensation; the uniform result of manifold
experience is a law. Here a double
objection arises: first, that the term “a
necessary sequence” presupposes a law,
and begs the question at issue; and, secondly,
that, this necessity unproved, such
truth is nothing more than a probability,
for it is impossible to be certain that our
next experiment may not have quite a different
result. Either this is not the road
to absolute truth, or absolute truth is unattainable.
The latter horn of the dilemma
is at once accepted; we neither know,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>nor can know, a law to be absolute; to us,
the absolute does not exist. Matter and
force with their relations are there, but
what we know of them is a varying quantity,
is of this age or the last, of this man
or that, dependent upon the extent and
accuracy of empirical science; we cannot
speak of what we do not know, and we
know no law that conceivable experience
might not contradict.</p>

<p class='c006'>But how, objects the reader, can this be
reconciled with the pure mathematics?
Here seem to be laws above experience,
laws admitting no exception.</p>

<p class='c006'>The response leads us back to the origin
of our notions of <i>Space</i> and <i>Time</i>, on the
the former of which mathematics is
founded. The supposition that they are
innate ideas is of course rejected by the
materialist; for he looks upon innate
ideas as fables; he considers them perceptions
derived positively from the senses,
but they do not belong to the senses alone,
nor are they perceptions merely; “they
are ideas, but ideas that without the sensuous
perceptions of proximity and sequence
could never have arisen. Nay, more—the
perception of space must precede that of
time,” for it is only through the former
that we can reach the latter. The plainest
laws of space, those which were the
earliest impressions on the <i>tabula rasa</i> of
the infant mind, and which the hourly experience
of life verifies, are called, by the
mathematician, <i>axioms</i>, and on these simplest
generalizations of our perceptions
he bases the whole of his structure. Axioms,
therefore, are the uniform results of
experiments, the possible conditions of
which are extremely limited, and the factors
of which have been subjected to all
these conditions.</p>

<p class='c006'>It follows from a denial of the absolute
that all existence is concrete. Indeed, we
may say that the corner stone of the edifice
of materialism is embraced in the terse
sentence of Moleschott—<i>all existence is existence
through attributes</i>. Existence <i>per
se</i> (<i>Fürsichsein</i>) is a meaningless term, and
substance apart from attribute, the <i>ens
ineffabile</i>, is a pedantic figment and nothing
more. Finally, there can be no attribute
except through a relation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let this trilogy of existence, attribute
and relation, be clearly before the mind,
and the position that the positive philosophy
bears to all others becomes at once
luminous enough. There is no existence
apart from attributes, no attributes but
through relations, no relations but to other
existences. To exemplify: a stone is heavy,
hard, colored, perhaps bitter to the taste.
Now, says the idealist, this weight, this
hardness, this color, this bitterness, these
are not the stone, they are merely its properties
or attributes, and the stone itself is
some substance behind them all, to which
they adhere and which we cannot detect
with our senses; further, he might add, if
a moderate in his school, these attributes
are independently existent, the bitterness
is there when we are not tasting it, and
the attribute of color, though there be no
light. All this the materialist denies. To
him, the attributes and nothing else constitute
the stone, and these attributes have
no existence apart from their relations to
other objects. The bitterness exists only
in relation to the organs of taste, and the
color to the organs of sight, and the weight
to other bodies of matter. Nothing, in
short, can be said to exist to us that is not
cognizable by our senses. But, objects
some one, there may be an existence which
is not <i>to us</i>, which is as much beyond our
ken as color is beyond the conception of
the born blind. The expression was used
advisedly: no such existence can become
the subject of rational language. “Does
not all knowledge predicate a knower, consequently
a relation of the subject to the
the observer? Such a relation is an attribute.
Without it, knowledge is inconceivable.
Neither God nor man can raise himself
above the knowledge furnished by
these relations to his organs of apprehension.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A disagreeable sequence to this logic
will not fail to occur to every one. If all
knowledge comes from the organs of sense,
then differently formed organs must furnish
very different and contradictory
knowledge, and one is as likely to be correct
as another. The radiate animal, who
sees the world through a cornea alone, must
have quite another notion of light, color,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>and relative size, from the spider whose
eye is provided with lenses and a vitreous
humor. Consonantly with the theory,
each of these probably opposing views is
equally true. This ugly dilemma is foreseen
by our author, for he grants that
“the knowledge of the insect, its knowledge
of the action of the outer world, is
altogether a different one from that of
man,” but he avoids the ultimate result of
this reasoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>To sum up the views of this school:
matter is eternal, force is eternal, but each
is impossible without the other; what bears
any relation to our senses we either know
or can know; what does not, it is absurd
to discuss; the highest thought is but the
physical elaboration of sensations, or, to
use the expression of Carl Vogt, “thought
is a secretion of the brain as urine is of the
kidneys. Without phosphorus there is no
thought.” “And so,” concludes Moleschott,
“only when thought is based on
fact, only when the reason is granted no
sphere of action but the historical which
arises from observation, when the perception
is at the same time thought, and the
understanding sees with consciousness,
does the contradiction between Philosophy
and Science disappear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This, then, is the last word of materialism,
this the solution it now offers us of
the great problem of Life. We enter no
further into its views, for all collateral
questions concerning the origin of the
ideas of the true, the good and the beautiful,
the vital force, and the spiritual life,
depend directly on the question we have
above mentioned. Let the reader turn back
precisely a century to the <i>Système de la
Nature</i>, so long a boasted bulwark of the
rationalistic school, and judge for himself
what advance, if any, materialism has
made in fortifying this, the most vital
point of her structure. Let him ask himself
anew whether the criticism of Hume
on the law of cause and effect can in any
way be met except after the example of
Kant, by the assumption of the absolute
idea, and we have little doubt what conclusion
he will arrive at in reference to
that system which, while it boasts to offer
the only method of discovering truth,
starts with the flat denial of all truth
other than relative.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>LETTERS ON FAUST. <br /> By <span class='sc'>H. C. Brockmeyer</span>.</h3>
<h4 class='c012'>I.</h4>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Dear H.</span>—Yours of a recent date, requesting
an epistolary criticism of “Goethe’s
Faust,” has come to hand, and I
hasten to assure you of a compliance of
some sort. I say a compliance of some
sort, for I cannot promise you a criticism.
This, it seems to me, would be both too
little and too much; too little if understood
in the ordinary sense, as meaning a
mere statement of the <i>relation</i> existing
between the work and myself; too much
if interpreted as pledging an expression of
a work of the creative imagination, as a
totality, in the terms of the understanding,
and submitting the result to the canons of
art.</p>

<p class='c006'>The former procedure, usually called
criticism, reduced to its simplest forms,
amounts to this: that I, the critic, report
to you, that I was amused or bored, flattered
or satirized, elevated or degraded,
humanized or brutalized, enlightened or
mystified, pleased or displeased, by the
work under consideration; and—since it
depends quite as much upon my own humor,
native ability, and culture acquired,
which set of adjectives I may be able to
report, as it does upon the work—I cannot
perceive what earthly profit such a labor
could be to you. For that which is clear
to you may be dark to me; hence, if I report
that a given work is a “perfect riddle
to me,” you will only smile at my simplicity.
Again, that which amuses me
may bore you, for I notice that even at the
theatre, some will yawn with <i>ennui</i> while
others thrill with delight, and applaud the
play. Now, if each of these should tell
you how <i>he</i> liked the performance, the one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>would say “excellent,” and the other
“miserable,” and you be none the wiser.
To expect, therefore, that I intend to enter
upon a labor of this kind, is to expect too
little.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides, such an undertaking seems to
me not without its peculiar danger; for it
may happen that the work measures or
criticises the critic, instead of the latter
the former. If, for example, I should tell
you that the integral and differential calculus
is all fog to me—mystifies me completely—you
would conclude my knowledge
of mathematics to be rather imperfect,
and thus use my own report of that work as
a sounding-lead to ascertain the depth of
my attainment. Nay, you might even go
further, and regard the work as a kind of
Doomsday Book, on the title page of
which I had “written myself down an
ass.” Now, as I am not ambitious of a
memorial of this kind, especially when
there is no probability that the pages in
contemplation—Goethe’s Faust—will perish
any sooner than the veritable Doomsday
Book itself, I request you, as a special
favor, not to understand of me that I propose
engaging in any undertaking of this
sort.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Nor are you to expect an inquiry into
the quantity or quality of the author’s
food, drink or raiment. For the present
infantile state of analytic science refuses
all aid in tracing such <i>primary</i> elements,
so to speak, in the composition of the
poem before us; and hence such an investigation
would lead, at best, to very secondary
and remote conclusions. Nor shall
we be permitted to explore the likes and
dislikes of the poet, in that fine volume of
scandal, for the kindred reason that neither
crucible, reagent nor retort are at
hand which can be of the remotest service.</p>

<p class='c006'>By the by, has it never occurred to you,
when perusing works of the kind last referred
to, what a glowing picture the pious
Dean of St. Patrick’s, the <i>saintly Swift</i>,
has bequeathed to us of their producers,
when he places the great authors, the
historical Gullivers of our race, in all
their majesty of form, astride the public
thoroughfare of a Liliputian age, and
marches the inhabitants, in solid battalions,
through between their legs? you recollect
what he says?</p>

<p class='c006'>Nor yet are you to expect a treat of that
most delightful of all compounds, the table
talk and conversation—or, to use a
homely phrase, the <i>literary dishwater</i>
retailed by the author’s scullion. To expect
such, or the like, would be to expect
too little.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, to expect that I shall
send you an expression, in the terms of
the understanding, of a work of the creative
imagination, as a totality, and submit
the result to the canons of art, is to expect
too much. For while I am ready,
and while I intend to comply with the
first part of this proposition, I am unable
to fulfil the requirement of the latter
part—that is, I am not able to submit the
result to the canons of art. The reason
for this inability it is not necessary to
develop in this connection any further
than merely to mention that I find it extremely
inconvenient to lay my hand upon
the aforementioned canons just at this
time.</p>

<p class='c006'>I must, therefore, content myself with
the endeavor to summon before you the
<i>Idea</i> which creates the poem—each act,
scene and verse—so that we may see the
part in its relation to the whole, and the
whole in its concrete, organic articulation.
If we succeed in this, then we may say
that we <i>comprehend</i> the work—a condition
precedent alike to the beneficial enjoyment
and the rational judgment of the same.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>II.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In my first letter, dear friend, I endeavored
to guard you against misapprehension
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>as to what you might expect from me. Its
substance, if memory serves me, was that
I did not intend to write on Anthropology
or Psychology, nor yet on street, parlor or
court gossip, but simply about a work of
art.</p>

<p class='c006'>I deemed these remarks pertinent in
view of the customs of the time, lest that,
in my not conforming to them, you should
judge me harshly without profit to yourself.
With the same desire of keeping up
a fair understanding with you, I must call
your attention to some terms and distinctions
which we shall have occasion to use,
and which, unless explained, might prove
shadows instead of lights along the path
of our intercourse.</p>

<p class='c006'>I confess to you that I share the (I might
say) abhorrence so generally entertained by
the reading public, of the use of any general
terms whatsoever, and would avoid
them altogether if I could only see how.
But in reading the poem that we are to
consider, I come upon such passages as
these:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(<i>Choir of invisible Spirits.</i>)</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“Woe! Woe!</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Thou hast destroyed it,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>The beautiful world!</div>
      <div class='line in6'>It reels, it crumbles,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crushed by a demigod’s mighty hand!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>and I cannot see how we are to understand
these spirits, or the poet who gave them
voice, unless we attack this very general
expression “The beautiful world,” here
said to have been destroyed by Faust.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am, however, somewhat reconciled to
this by the example of my neighbor—a
non-speculative, practical farmer—now
busily engaged in harvesting his wheat.
For I noticed that he first directed his attention,
after cutting the grain, to collecting
and tying it together in bundles; and
I could not help but perceive how much
this facilitated his labor, and how difficult
it would have been for him to collect his
wheat, grain by grain, like the sparrow of
the field. Though wheat it were, and not
chaff, still such a mode of handling would
reduce it even below the value of chaff.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just think of handling the wheat crop
of these United States, the two hundred
and twenty-five millions of bushels a year,
in this manner! It is absolutely not to be
thought of, and we must have recourse to
agglomeration, if not to generalization.
But the one gives us general <i>masses</i>, and
the other general <i>terms</i>. The only thing
that we can do, therefore, is, in imitation
of our good neighbor of the wheat field,
to handle bundles, bushels, and bags, or—what
is still better, if it can be done by
some daring system of intellectual elevators—whole
ship loads of grain at a time,
due care being taken that we tie wheat to
wheat, oats to oats, barley to barley, and
not promiscuously.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, with this example well before our
minds, and the necessity mentioned, which
compels us to handle—not merely the
wheat crop of the United States for one
year, but—whatever has been raised by
the intelligence of man from the beginning
of our race to the time of Goethe
the poet, together with the ground on
which it was raised, and the sky above—for
no less than this seems to be contained
in the expression “The beautiful world”—I
call your attention first to the expression
“form and matter,” which, when applied
to works of intelligence, we must take the
liberty of changing into the expression
“form and content,” for since there is
nothing in works of this kind that manifests
gravity, it can be of no use to say so,
but may be of some injury.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next is the expression “works of
art,” which sounds rather suspicious in
some of its applications—sounds as if it
was intended to conceal rather than reveal
the worker. Now I take it that the
“works of art” are the works of the intelligence,
and I shall have to classify
them accordingly. Another point with
reference to this might as well be noticed,
and that is that the old expressions
“works of art” and “works of nature”
do not contain, as they were intended to,
all the works that present themselves to
our observation—the works of science, for
example. Besides, we have government,
society, and religion, all of which are undoubtedly
distinct from the “works of
art” no less than from the “works of nature,”
and to tie them up in the same bundle
with either of them, seems to me to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>like tying wheat with oats, and therefore
to be avoided, as in the example before our
minds. This seems to be done in the expression
“works of self-conscious intelligence,”
and “works of nature.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But if we reflect upon the phrases
“works of self-conscious intelligence”
and “works of nature,” it becomes obvious
that there must be some inaccuracy
contained in them; for how can two distinct
subjects have the same predicate? It
would, therefore, perhaps be better to say
“the works of self-conscious intelligence”
and the “<i>products</i> of nature.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Without further rasping and filing of
old phrases, I call your attention, in the
next place, to the most general term which
we shall have occasion to use—“the
world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Under this we comprehend:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I. The natural world—Gravity.;</div>
      <div class='line'>II. The spiritual world—Self-determination.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I. Under the natural world we comprehend the terrestrial globe, and that part of the
universe which is involved in its processes; these are:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(<i>a</i>) (1.) Mechanic=Gravity, } Meteorologic=Electricity.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>(2.) Chemic=Affinity,  }</div>
      <div class='line'>(<i>b</i>) (1.) Organic=Galvanism,       } Vital=Sensation.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>(2.) Vegetative=Assimilation, }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>II. Under “The Spiritual World,” the world of conscious intelligence, we comprehend:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(<i>a</i>) The real world=implement, mediation.</div>
      <div class='line'>(<i>b</i>) The actual world=self-determination.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>(<i>a</i>) The real world contains whatever derives the end of its existence only, from
self-conscious intelligence.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(1.) The family=Affection.</div>
      <div class='line'>(2.) Society=Ethics, } Mediation.</div>
      <div class='line'>(3.) State=Rights,   }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>(<i>b</i>) The actual world contains whatever derives the end and the <i>means</i> of its existence
from self-conscious intelligence.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(1.) Art=Manifestation,     }</div>
      <div class='line'>(2.) Religion=Revelation,   } Self-determination.</div>
      <div class='line'>(3.) Philosophy=Definition, }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>From this it appears that we have divided
the world into three large slices—the
Natural, the Real, and the Actual—with
gravity for one and self-determination for
the other extreme, and mediation between
them.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>III.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In my last, I gave you some general
terms, and the sense in which I intend
to use them. I also gave you a reason
why I should use them, together with
an illustration. But I gave you no reason
why I used these and no others—or
I did not advance anything to show that
there are <i>objects</i> to which they <i>necessarily
apply</i>. I only take it for granted that
there are some objects presented to your
observation and mine, that gravitate or
weigh something, and others that do not.
To each I have applied as nearly as I could
the ordinary terms. Now this procedure,
although very unphilosophical, I can justify
only by reminding you of the object of
these letters.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we now listen again to the chant of
the invisible choir,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thou hast destroyed it,</div>
      <div class='line'>The beautiful world,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>it will be obvious that this can refer only
to the world of mediation and self-determination,
to the world of spirit, of self-conscious
intelligence, for the world of
gravitation is not so easily affected. But
how is this—how is it that the world of
self-conscious intelligence is so easily
affected, is so dependent upon the individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>man? This can be seen only by examining
its genesis.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the genesis of Spirit we have three
stages—manifestation, realization, and
actualization. The first of these, upon
which the other two are dependent and
sequent, falls in the individual man. For,
in him it is that Reason manifests itself
before it can realize, or embody itself in
this or that political, social, or moral institution.
And it is not merely necessary
that it should so manifest itself in the individual;
it must also realize itself in
these institutions before it can actualize
itself in Art, Religion, and Philosophy.
For in this actualization it is absolutely
dependent upon the former two stages of
its genesis for a content. From this it
appears that Art <i>shows</i> what Religion
<i>teaches</i>, and what Philosophy <i>comprehends</i>;
or that Art, Religion, and Philosophy
have the same content. Nor is it
difficult to perceive why this world of
spirit or self-conscious intelligence is so
dependent upon the individual man.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in the sphere of manifestation
and reality, this content, the self-conscious
intelligence, is the <i>self-consciousness</i> of an
individual, a nation, or an age. And art,
in the sphere of actuality, is this or that
work of art, this poem, that painting, or
yonder piece of sculpture, with the self-consciousness
of this or that individual,
nation, or age, for its content. Moreover,
the particularity (the individual, nation, or
age) of the content constitutes the individuality
of the work of Art. And not only
this, but this particularity of the <i>self-consciousness</i>
furnishes the very contradiction
itself with the development and solution
of which the work of art is occupied.
For the self-consciousness which constitutes
the content, being the self consciousness
of an individual, a nation, or an age,
instead of being self-conscious intelligence
in its pure universality, contains in that
very particularity the contradiction which,
in the sphere of manifestation and reality,
constitutes the collision, conflict, and solution.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Now, if we look back upon the facts
stated, we have the manifestation, the
realization, and the actualization of self-conscious
intelligence as the three spheres
or stages in the process which evolves and
involves the entire activity of man, both
practical and theoretical. It is also obvious
that the realization of self-conscious
intelligence in the family, society, and the
state, and its actualization in Art, Religion,
and Philosophy, depend in their genesis
upon its manifestation in the individual.
Hence a denial of the possibility of
this manifestation is a denial of the possibility
of the realization and actualization
also.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now if this denial assume the form of a
conviction in the consciousness of an individual,
a nation, or an age, then there
results a contradiction which involves in
the sweep of its universality the entire
spiritual world of man. For it is the self-consciousness
of that individual, nation,
or age, in direct conflict with itself, not
with this or that particularity of itself,
but with its entire content, in the sphere
of manifestation, with the receptivity for,
the production of, and the aspiration after,
the Beautiful, the Good, and the True,
within the individual himself; in the
sphere of realization with the Family,
with Society, and with the State; and
finally, in the sphere of actuality with
Art, Religion, and Philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now this contradiction is precisely
what is presented in the proposition,
“Man cannot know truth.” This you
will remember was, in the history of modern
thought, the result of Kant’s philosophy.
And Kant’s philosophy was the
philosophy of Germany at the time of the
conception of Goethe’s Faust. And Goethe
was the truest poet of Germany, and thus
he sings:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So then I have studied philosophy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Jurisprudence and medicine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what is worse, Theology,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thoroughly, but, alas! in vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And here I stand with study hoar,</div>
      <div class='line'>A fool, and know what I knew before;</div>
      <div class='line'>Am called Magister, nay, LL.D.,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
 <div class='line c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>And for ten years, am busily</div>
      <div class='line'>Engaged, leading through fen and close,</div>
      <div class='line'>My trusting pupils by the nose;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet see that nothing can be known.</div>
      <div class='line'>This burns my heart, this, this alone!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Here, you will perceive in the first sentence
of the poem, as was meet, the fundamental
contradiction, the theme, or the
“argument,” as it is so admirably termed
by critics, is stated in its naked abstractness,
just as Achilles’ wrath is the first
sentence of the Iliad.</p>

<p class='c006'>This theme, then, is nothing more nor
less than the self-consciousness in contradiction
with itself, in conflict with its own
content. Hence, if the poem is to portray
this theme, this content, in its totality, it
must represent it in three spheres: first,
Manifestation—Faust in conflict with himself;
second, Realization—Faust in conflict
with the Family, Society, and the State;
thirdly, Actualization—Faust in conflict
with Art, Religion, and Philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, my friend, please to examine the
poem once more, reflect closely upon what
has been said, and then tell how much of
the poem can you spare, or how much is
there in the poem as printed, which does
not flow from or develop this theme?</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IV.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In my last, dear friend, I called your attention
to the theme, to the content of the
poem in a general way, stating it in the
very words of the poet himself. To trace
the development of this theme from the
abstract generality into concrete detail is
the task before us.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to the analysis, we have to
consider, first of all, the sphere of <i>Manifestation</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this we observe the three-fold relation
which the individual sustains to self-conscious
intelligence, viz: Receptivity for,
and production of, and aspiration for, the
True, the Good, and the Beautiful. Now
if it is true that man cannot know truth,
then it follows that he can neither receive
nor produce the True. For how shall he
know that whatever he may receive and
produce is true, since it is specially denied
that he can know it. This conclusion
as conviction, however, does not affect immediately
the third relation—the aspiration—nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>quench its gnawing. And this
is the first form of conflict in the individual.
Let us now open the book and place it before
us.</p>

<p class='c006'>The historic origin of our theme places
us in a German University, in the professor’s
private studio.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is well here to remember that it is a
German University, and that the occupant
of the room is a <i>German</i> professor. Also
that it is the received opinion that the
Germans are a <i>theoretical</i> people; by
which we understand that they act from
conviction, and not from instinct. Moreover,
that their conviction is not a mere
holiday affair, to be rehearsed, say on
Sunday, and left in charge of a minister,
paid for the purpose, during the balance
of the week, but an actual, vital fountain
of action. Hence, the conviction of such
a character being given, the acts follow in
logical sequence.</p>

<p class='c006'>With this remembered, let us now listen
to the self-communion of the occupant of
the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>In bitter earnest the man has honestly
examined, and sought to possess himself
of the intellectual patrimony of the race.
In poverty, in solitude, in isolation, he
has labored hopefully, earnestly; and now
he casts up his account and finds—what?
“That nothing can be known.” His hair
is gray with more than futile endeavor,
and for ten years his special calling has
been to guide the students to waste their
lives, as he has done his own, in seeking
to accomplish the impossible—to know.
This is the worm that gnaws his heart!
As compensation, he is free from superstition—fears
neither hell nor devil. But
this sweeps with it all fond delusions, all
conceit that he is able to know, and to
teach something for the elevation of mankind.
Nor yet does he possess honor or
wealth—a dog would not lead a life like
this.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here you will perceive how the first two
relations are negated by the conviction
that man cannot know truth, and how, on
the wings of aspiration, he sallies forth
into the realm of magic, of mysticism, of
subjectivity. For if reason, with its mediation,
is impotent to create an object for
this aspiration, let us see what emotion
and imagination, <i>without</i> mediation, can
do for subjective satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>And here all is glory, all is freedom!
The imagination seizes the totality of the
universe, and revels in ecstatic visions.
What a spectacle! But, alas! a spectacle
only! How am I to know, to comprehend
the fountain of life, the centre of which
articulates this totality?</p>

<p class='c006'>See here another generalization: the
practical world as a whole! Ah, that is
my sphere; here I have a firm footing;
here I am master; here I command spirits!
Approach, and obey your master!</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Spirit.</i> Who calls?</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Faust.</i> Terrific face!</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Sp.</i> Art thou he that called?</p>

<p class='c017'>        Thou trembling worm!</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Faust.</i> Yes; I’m he; am Faust, thy peer.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Sp.</i> Peer of the Spirit thou comprehendest—not of
me!</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Faust.</i> What! not of thee! Of whom, then? I,
the image of Deity itself, and not even thy
peer?“</p>

<p class='c010'>No, indeed, Mr. Faust, thou dost not include
within thyself the totality of the
practical world, but only that part thereof
which thou dost comprehend—only thy
<i>vocation</i>, and hark! “It knocks!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Oh, death! I see, ’t is my vocation; indeed,
“It is my famulus!”</p>

<p class='c006'>And this, too, is merely a delusion; this
great mystery of the practical world
shrinks to this dimension—a bread-professorship.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would seem so; for no theory of the
practical world is possible without the
ability to know truth. As individual, you
may imitate the individual, as the brute
his kind, and thus transmit a craft; but
you cannot seize the practical world in
transparent forms and present it as a harmonious
totality to your fellow-man, for
that would require that these transparent
intellectual forms should possess objective
validity—and this they have not, according
to your conviction. And so it
cannot be helped.</p>

<p class='c006'>But see what a despicable thing it is to
be a bread-professor!</p>

<p class='c006'>And is this the mode of existence, this
the reality, the only reality to answer the
aspiration of our soul—the aspiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>which sought to seize the universe, to kindle
its inmost recesses with the light of
intelligence, and thus illumine the path of
life? Alas, Reason gave us error—Imagination,
illusion—and the practical world,
the <i>Will</i>, a bread-professorship! Nothing
else? Yes; a bottle of laudanum!</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us drink, and rest forever! But
hold, is there nothing else, really? No
emotional nature? Hark! what is that?
Easter bells! The recollections of my
youthful faith in a revelation! They must
be examined. We cannot leave yet.</p>

<p class='c006'>And see what a panorama, what a
strange world lies embedded with those
recollections. Let us see it in all its
varied character and reality, on this Easter
Sunday, for example.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>V.</h4>
<p class='c005'>I have endeavored before to trace the
derivation of the content of the first
scene of the poem, together with its
character, from the abstract theme of the
work. In it we saw that the fundamental
conviction of Faust leaves him naked—leaves
him nothing but a bare avocation, a
mere craft, and the precarious recollections
of his youth (when he believed in
revealed truths) to answer his aspirations.
These recollections arouse his emotions,
and rescue him from nothingness (suicide)—they
fill his soul with a content.</p>

<p class='c006'>To see this content with all its youthful
charm, we have to retrace our childhood’s
steps before the gates of the city on this
the Easter festival of the year—you and I
being mindful, in the meantime, that the
public festivals of the Church belong to
the so-called external evidences of the
truth of the Christian Religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Well, here we are in the suburbs of the
city, and what do we see? First, a set of
journeymen mechanics, eager for beer and
brawls, interspersed with servant girls;
students whose tastes run very much in
the line of strong beer, biting tobacco,
and the well-dressed servant girls aforesaid;
citizens’ daughters, perfectly outraged
at the low taste of the students
who run after the servant girls, “when
they might have the very best of society;”
citizens dissatisfied with the new mayor of
the city—“Taxes increase from day to
day, and nothing is done for the welfare
of the city.” A beggar is not wanting.
Other citizens, who delight to speak of
war and rumors of war in distant countries,
in order to enjoy their own peace at
home with proper contrast; also an “elderly
one,” who thinks that she is quite
able to furnish what the well-dressed citizens’
daughters wish for—to the great
scandal of the latter, who feel justly indignant
at being addressed in public by
such an old witch (although, “between
ourselves, she did show us our sweethearts
on St. Andrew’s night”); soldiers, who
sing of high-walled fortresses and proud
women to be taken by storm; and, finally,
farmers around the linden tree, dancing a
most furious gallopade—a real Easter
Sunday or Monday “before the gate”—of
any city in Germany, even to this day.</p>

<p class='c006'>And into this real world, done up in
holiday attire, but not by the poet—into
this paradise, this very heaven of the people,
where great and small fairly yell with
delight—Faust enters, assured that here
he can maintain his rank as a man; “here
I dare to be a man!” And, sure enough,
listen to the welcome:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Nay, Doctor, ’tis indeed too much</div>
      <div class='line'>To be with us on such a day,</div>
      <div class='line'>To join the throng, the common mass,</div>
      <div class='line'>You, you, the great, the learned man!</div>
      <div class='line'>Take, then, this beaker, too,” &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>And here goes—a general health to the
Doctor, to the man who braved the pestilence
for us, and who even now, does not
think it beneath him to join us in our
merry-making—hurrah for the Doctor;
hip, hip, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>And is not this something, dear friend?
Just think, with honest Wagner, when he
exclaims, “What emotions must crowd
thy breast, O great man, while listening
to such honors?” and you will also say
with him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thrice blest the man who draws such profits rare,</div>
      <div class='line'>From talents all his own!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Why, see! the father shows you to his
son; every one inquires—presses, rushes
to see you! The fiddle itself is hushed,
the dancers stop. Where you go, they fall
into lines; caps and hats fly into the air!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>But a little more, and they would fall upon
their knees, as if the sacred Host passed
that way!</p>

<p class='c006'>And is not this great? Is not this the
very goal of human ambition? To Wagner,
dear friend, it is; for the very essence
of an avocation is, and must be, “success
in life.” But how does it stand with the
man whose every aspiration is the True,
the Good, and the Beautiful? Will a
hurrah from one hundred thousand
throats, all in good yelling order, assist
him? <i>No.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>To Wagner it is immaterial whether he
<i>knows</i> what he <i>needs</i>, provided he sees the
day when the man who has been worse to
the people than the very pestilence itself,
receives public honors; but to Faust, to
the man really in earnest—who is not satisfied
when he has squared life with life,
and obtained zero for a result, or who
does not merely <i>live to make a living</i>, but
demands a rational end for life, and, in
default of that rational end, spurns life
itself—to such a man this whole scene
possesses little significance indeed. It
possesses, however, <i>some</i> significance, even
for him! For if it is indeed true that man
cannot know truth—that the high aspiration
of his soul has no object—then this
scene demonstrates, at least, that Faust
possesses power over the practical world.
If he cannot <i>know</i> the world, he can
at least swallow a considerable portion
of it, and this scene demonstrates that he
can exercise a great deal of choice as to
the parts to be selected; do you see this
conviction?</p>

<p class='c006'>Do you see this conviction? Do you
see this dog? Consider it well; what is
it, think you? Do you perceive how it
encircles us nearer and nearer—becomes
more and more certain, and, if I mistake
not, a luminous emanation of gold, of
honor, of power, follows in its wake. It
seems to me as if it drew soft magic rings,
as future fetters, round our feet! See,
the circles become smaller and smaller-’tis
almost a certainty—’tis already near;
come, come home with as!</p>

<p class='c006'>The temptation here spread before us
by the poet, to consider the dog “<i>well</i>,” is
almost irresistible; but all we can say in
this place, dear friend, is that if you will
look upon what is properly called an
<i>avocation</i> in civil society, eliminate from
it all higher ends and motives other than
the simple one of making a living—no
matter with what pomp and circumstance—no
doubt you will readily recognize
the <span class='fss'>POODLE</span>. But we must hasten to the
studio to watch further developments, for
the conflict is not as yet decided. We
are still to examine the possibility of a
divine revelation to man, who cannot know
truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>And for this purpose our newly acquired
conviction, that we possess power over the
practical world—although not as yet in a
perfectly clear form before us—comfortably
lodged behind the stove, where it
properly belongs, we take down the original
text of the New Testament in order to
realize its meaning, in our own loved
mother tongue. It stands written: “In
the beginning was the Word.” Word?
Word? Never! <i>Meaning</i> it ought to be!
Meaning what? Meaning? No; it is
<i>Power</i>! No; <i>Deed</i>! Word, meaning,
power, deed—which is it? Alas, how am
I to know, unless I can know truth? ’Tis
even so, our youthful recollections dissolve
in mist, into thin air—and nothing is
left us but our newly acquired conviction,
the restlessness of which during this examination
has undoubtedly not escaped
your attention, dear friend. (“Be quiet,
there, behind the stove.” “See here,
poodle, one of us two has to leave this
room!”) What, then, is the whole content
of this conviction, which, so long as there
was the hope of a possibility of a worthy
object for our aspiration, seemed so despicable?
What is it that governs the
practical world of finite motives, the
power that adapts means to ends, regardless
of a final, of an infinite end? Is it
not the Understanding? and although
Reason—in its search after the <i>final end</i>,
with its perfect system of absolute means,
of infinite motives and interests—begets
subjective chimeras, is it not demonstrated
that the understanding possesses objective
validity? Nay, look upon this dog well;
does it not swell into colossal proportions—is
no dog at all, in fact, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>very power that holds absolute sway over
the finite and negative—the understanding
itself—Mephistopheles in proper form?</p>

<p class='c006'>And who calls this despicable? Is it
not Reason, the power that begets chimeras,
and it alone? And shall we reject
the real, the actual—all in fact that possesses
objective validity—because, forsooth,
the power of subjective chimeras
declares it negative, finite, perishable?
Never. “No fear, dear sir, that I’ll do
this. Precisely what I have promised is
the very aim of all my endeavor. Conceited
fool that I was! I prized myself
too highly”—claimed kin with the infinite.
“I belong only in thy sphere”—the
finite. “The Great Spirit scorns me.
Nature is a sealed book to me; the thread
of thought is severed. Knowing disgusts
me. In the depths of sensuality I’ll
quench the burning passion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here, then, my friend, we arrive at the
final result of the conflict in the first
sphere of our theme—in the sphere of
manifestation—that of the individual.
We started with the conviction <i>that man
cannot know truth</i>. This destroyed our
spiritual endeavors, and reduced our practical
avocation to an absurdity. We
sought refuge in the indefinite—the mysticism
of the past—and were repelled by
its subjectivity. We next examined the
theoretical side of the practical world, and
found this likewise an impossibility and
suicide—a mere blank nothingness—as
the only resource. But here we were
startled by our emotional nature, which
unites us with our fellow-man, and seems
to promise some sort of a bridge over into
the infinite—certainly demands such a
transition. Investigating this, therefore,
with all candor, we found our fellow-men
wonderfully occupied—occupied like the
kitten pursuing its own tail! At the
same time it became apparent that we
might be quite a dog in this kitten dance,
or that the activity of the understanding
possessed objective validity. With this
conviction fairly established, although
still held in utter contempt, we examined
the last resource: the possibility of a
divine revelation of truth to men that cannot
know truth. The result, as the mere
statement of the proposition would indicate,
is negative, and thus the last chance
of obtaining validity for anything except
the activity of the understanding vanishes
utterly. But with this our contempt for
the understanding likewise vanishes. For
whatever our aspiration may say, it has
no object to correspond to it, and is therefore
merely subjective, a hallucination, a
chimera, and the understanding is the
highest attainable for us. Here, therefore,
the subjective conflict ends, for we have
attained to objectivity, and this is the
highest, since there is nothing else that
possesses validity for man. Nor is this
by any means contemptible in itself,
for it is the power over the finite world,
and the net result is: That if you and I,
my friend, have no reason, cannot know
truth, we do have at least a stomach, a
capacity for sensual enjoyment, and an
understanding to administer to the same—to
be its servant. This, at least, is demonstrated
by the kitten dance of the
whole world.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY.</h3>
<h4 class='c012'>CHAPTER V. <br /> NECESSITY, CHANCE, FREEDOM.</h4>
<h4 class='c012'>I.</h4>
<p class='c005'>All things are necessitated; each is necessitated
by the totality of conditions;
hence, whatever is must be so, and under
the conditions cannot be otherwise.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Remark.</i>—This is the most exhaustive
statement of the position of the “understanding.”
Nothing seems more clear than
this to the thinker who has advanced beyond
the sensuous grade of consciousness
and the stages of Perception.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>II.</h4>
<p class='c005'>But things change—something new begins
and something old ceases; but, still,
in each case, the first principle must apply,
and the new thing—like the old—be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>so “because necessitated by the totality
of conditions.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Remark.</i>—The reader will notice that
with the conception of <i>change</i> there enters
a second stage of mediation. First, we
have simple mediation in which the ground
and grounded are both real. Secondly, we
have the passage of a potentiality into a
reality, and <i>vice versa</i>. Therefore, with
the consideration of change we have encountered
a contradiction which becomes
apparent upon further attempt to adjust
the idea of necessity to it.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>III.</h4>
<p class='c005'>If the same totality of conditions necessitates
both states of the thing—the new
and the old—it follows that this totality
of conditions is adapted to both, and hence
is indifferent to either, i. e. it allows either,
and hence cannot be said to necessitate one
to the exclusion of the other, for it allows
one to pass over into the other, thereby
demonstrating that it did not restrict or
confine the first to be what it was. Hence
it now appears that chance or contingency
participated in the state of the thing.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IV.</h4>
<p class='c005'>But the states of the thing belong to the
totality, and hence when the thing changes
the totality also changes, and we are forced
to admit two different totalities as the conditions
of the two different states of the
thing.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Remark.</i>—Here we have returned to our
starting-point, and carried back our contradiction
with us. In our zeal to relieve the
thing from the difficulty presented—that of
changing spontaneously—we have posited
duality in the original totality, and pushed
our <i>change</i> into <i>it</i>. But it is the same contradiction
as before, and we must continue
to repeat the same process forever in the
foolish endeavor to go round a circle until
we arrive at its end, or, what is the same,
its beginning.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>V.</h4>
<p class='c005'>If it requires a different totality of conditions
to render possible the change of a
thing from one state to another, then if a
somewhat changes the totality changes.
But there is nothing outside of the totality
to necessitate <i>it</i>, and it therefore must necessitate
<i>itself</i>.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>VI.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Thus necessity and necessitated have
proved in the last analysis to be one.
This, however, is necessity no longer, but
spontaneity, for it begins with itself and
ends with itself. (<i>a</i>) As <i>necessitating</i> it is
the active determiner which of course contains
the <i>potentiality</i> upon which it acts.
Had it no potentiality it could not change.
(<i>b</i>) As <i>necessitated</i> it is the potentiality
<i>plus</i> the limit which its activity has fixed
there. (<i>c</i>) But we have here self-determination,
and thus the <i>existence</i> of the Universal
in and for itself, which is the <i>Ego</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Remark.</i>—It cannot be any other mode
of existence than the Ego, for that which
dissolves all determinations and is the universal
potentiality is only <i>one</i> and cannot
be distinguished into <i>modes</i>, for it creates
and destroys these. The ego can abstract
all else and yet abide—it is the <i>actus
purus</i>—its negativity annulling all determinations
and finitudes, while it is directed
full on itself, and is in that very act
complete self-recognition. (See proof of
this in Chapter IV., <span class='fss'>III.</span>, 3.)</p>
<h4 class='c012'>VII.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Thus the doctrine of necessity presupposes
self-determination or Freedom as the
form of the Total, and necessity is only
one side—the realized or <i>determined</i> side—of
the process isolated and regarded in
this state of isolation. Against this side
stands the potentiality which, if isolated
in like manner, is called Chance or Contingency.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CHAPTER VI. <br /> OF MEDIATION.</h4>
<p class='c005'>The comprehension of mediation lies at
the basis of the distinction of sensuous
knowing from the <i>understanding</i>. The
transition from <i>intuition</i> to <i>abstract thinking</i>
is made at first unconsciously, and for
this reason the one who has begun the process
of mediation handles the “mental
spectres” created by abstraction with the
utmost naïveté, assuming for them absolute
validity in the world at large. It is only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the speculative insight that gains mastery
over such abstractions, and sees the Truth.
If this view could be unfolded in a popular
form, it would afford a series of solvents
for the thinker which are applicable to a
great variety of difficult problems. For it
must be remembered that the abstract
categories of the understanding—such as
<i>essence and phenomenon</i>, <i>cause and effect</i>,
<i>substance and attribute</i>, <i>force and manifestation</i>,
<i>matter and form</i>, and the like, give
rise to a series of <i>antinomies</i>, or contradictory
propositions, when applied to the
Totality. From the standpoint of mediation—that
of simple reflection, “common
sense” so called—these antinomies seem
utterly insoluble. The reason of this is
found in the fact that “common sense”
places implicit faith in these categories
(just mentioned), and never rises to the
investigation of them by themselves. To
consider the validity of these categories
by themselves is called a <i>transcendental</i>
procedure, for it passes beyond the ordinary
thinking which uses them without distrust.</p>

<p class='c006'>The transcendental investigation shows
that the insolubility attributed to these
antinomies arises from the mistake of the
thinker, who supposes the categories he
employs to be exhaustive. Speculative
insight begins with the perception that
they are not exhaustive; that they have by
a species of enchantment cast a spell upon
the mind, under which every thing seems
dual, and the weary seeker after Truth
wanders through a realm of abstractions
each of which assumes the form of a solid
reality—now a giant, and now a dwarf,
and now an impassible river, impenetrable
forest, or thick castle wall defended by
dragons.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following questions will illustrate
the character of the problems here described:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why deal with abstractions—why not
hold fast by the concrete reality?”</p>

<p class='c006'>(This position combats mediation under
its form of <i>abstraction</i>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can we not know <i>immediately</i> by intuition
those objects that philosophy strives
in vain to comprehend? in short, are not
God, Freedom and Immortality certain to
us and yet indemonstrable?”</p>

<p class='c006'>(This position combats mediation as involved
in a <i>system</i> of Philosophy.)</p>

<p class='c006'>These questions arise only in the mind
that has already gone beyond the doctrine
that it attempts to defend, and hence a self
refutation is easily drawn out of the source
from whence they originate.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>ABSTRACTION.</h4>
<p class='c005'>(<i>a</i>) It will be readily granted that all
knowing involves <i>distinction</i>. We must
distinguish one object from another.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b</i>) But the process of distinguishing is
a process that involves abstraction. For
in separating this object from that, I contrast
its marks, properties, <i>attributes</i>, with
those of the other. In seizing upon one
characteristic I must isolate it from all
others, and this is nothing more nor less
than abstraction.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c</i>) Therefore it is absurd to speak
of knowing without abstraction, for
this enters into the simplest act of perception.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>d</i>) Nor is this a subjective defect, an
“impotency of our mental structure,” as
some would be ready to exclaim at this
point. For it is just as evident that <i>things
themselves</i> obtain reality only through
these very characteristics. One thing preserves
its distinctness from another by
means of its various <i>determinations</i>. Without
these determinations all would collapse
into <i>one</i>, nay, even “<i>one</i>” would vanish,
for distinction being completely gone, <i>one-ness</i>
is not possible. This is the “<i>Principle
of Indiscernibles</i>” enunciated by Leibnitz.
Thus distinction is as necessary objectively
as subjectively. The thing <i>abstracts</i> in
order to be <i>real</i>. It defends itself against
what lies without it by specializing itself
into single properties, and thus becoming
in each a mere abstraction.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>e</i>) Moreover, besides this prevalence of
abstraction in the <i>theoretic</i> field, it is still
more remarkable in the <i>practical</i> world.
The business man decries abstractions. He
does not know that every act of the will
is an abstraction, and that it is also preceded
by an abstraction. When he exhorts
you to “leave off abstractions and deal
with concrete realities,” he does this: (1.)
he regards you as he thinks you are; (2.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>he conceives you as different, i. e. as a
<i>practical</i> man; (3.) he exhorts you to
change from your real state to the possible
one which he conceives of (through the
process of abstraction). The simplest act
with design—that of going to dinner, for
example—involves abstraction. If I raise
my arm on purpose, I first abstract from
its real position, and think it under another
condition.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>f</i>) But the chief point in all this is to
mark how the mind frees itself from the
untruth of abstraction. For it must be
allowed that all abstractions are false.
The isolation of that which is not sufficient
for its own existence, (though as we have
seen, a necessary constituent of the process
of <i>knowing</i> and of <i>existing</i>,) sets up an
untruth as existent. Therefore the mind
thinks this isolation only as a moment of
a <i>negative unity</i>, (i. e. as an element of a
process). This leads us to the consideration
of mediation in the more general form,
involved by the second question.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IMMEDIATE KNOWING.</h4>
<p class='c005'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Definition.</i>—“Immediate” is a predicate
applied to what is directly through
itself. The immediateness of anything is
the phase that first presents itself. It is
the undeveloped—an <i>oak</i> taken immediately
is an <i>acorn</i>; man taken immediately
is a child at birth.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Definition.</i>—“Mediation” signifies
the process of realization. A <i>mediate</i> or
<i>mediated</i> somewhat is what it is through
another, or through a process.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Principle.</i>—Any concrete somewhat
exists through its relations to all else in
the universe; hence all concrete somewhats
are <i>mediated</i>. “If a grain of sand
were destroyed the universe would collapse.”</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>d</i>) <i>Principle.</i>—An absolutely <i>immediate</i>
somewhat would be a pure nothing, for the
reason that no determination could belong
to it, (for determination is negative, and
hence mediation). Hence all immediateness
must be phenomenal, or the result of
abstraction from the concrete whole, and
this, of course, exhibits the contradiction
of an immediate which is mediated (a “<i>result</i>.”)</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>e</i>) The solution of this contradiction is
found in “self-determination,” (as we
have seen in former chapters). The self-determined
is a mediated; it is <i>through
the process</i> of determination; but is likewise
an <i>immediate</i>, for it is its own mediation,
and hence it is the beginning and
end—<i>it begins with its result, and ends in
its beginning</i>, and thus it is a circular process.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the great <i>aperçu</i> of all speculative
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>f</i>) <i>Definition.</i>—Truth is the form of
the Total, or that which actually exists.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>g</i>) Hence a knowing of Truth must be
a knowing of the self-determined, which is
both immediate and mediate. This is a
process or <i>system</i>. Therefore the knowing
of it cannot be simply <i>immediate</i>, but must
be in the form of a system. Thus the so-called
“immediate intuition” is not a
knowing of truth unless inconsistent with
what it professes.</p>
<h3 class='c014'>THE PHILOSOPHY OF BAADER.</h3>
<p class='c009'>[The following letter from Dr. Franz Hoffmann to the St. Louis Philosophical Society has
been handed us for publication. It gives us pleasure to lay before our readers so able a presentation
of the claims of Baader, and we trust that some of our countrymen will be led by it to
investigate the original sources herein referred to.</p>

<p class='c017'>We are requested to correct a misstatement that occurs in the first paragraph regarding the
objects of the Philosophical Society. It was not founded for the special purpose of “studying
German Philosophy from Kant to Hegel,” although it has many members who are occupied
chiefly in that field. The Society includes among its members advocates of widely differing
systems, all, however, working in the spirit of the Preamble to the Constitution, which says:
“The object of this Society is to encourage the study and development of Speculative Philosophy;
to foster an application of its results to Art, Science, and Religion; and to establish a
philosophical basis for the professions of Law, Medicine, Divinity, Politics, Education, Art, and
Literature.” We are indebted to Dr. A. Strothotte for the translation of the letter.—<span class='sc'>Editor.</span>]</p>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Würzburg</span>, Dec. 28, 1866.</p>
<p class='c005'><i>Mr. President</i>: In the first number of
Vol. XLIX of the “<i>Zeitschrift für Philosophie</i>,”
published at Halle, in Prussia,
edited by Fichte, Ulrici and Wirth, notice
is taken of a philosophical society, organized
at St. Louis, with the object of pursuing
the study of German philosophy
from Kant to Hegel.</p>

<p class='c006'>This fact promises a correlation of philosophical
movements between North America
and Germany which is of great importance.
I presume, however, that you have
already been led, or that you will be led,
to go back beyond Kant to the first traces
of German philosophy, and proceed from
Hegel to the present time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, although a thorough and comprehensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>view of Hegel’s philosophy is in
the first place to be recommended, yet
the other directions in the movement of
thought must not be lost sight of.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Berlin organ of the Philosophical
Society of the Hegelians—<i>Der Gedanke</i>—edited
by Michelet, may be found, as you
perhaps know, an index of the works of
Hegel’s school, by Rosenkranz, whereas on
the other hand the rich literature of the
anti-Hegelian writers is nowhere met with
in any degree of completeness. Many of
them, however, are noticed in Fichte’s
journal, and in the more recent works on
the history of philosophy, particularly in
those of Erdmann, and still more in those
of Ueberweg.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the prominent movements in
philosophical thinking, during and after
the time of Hegel, the profound utterances
of a great and genial teacher, Franz Baader,
reach a degree of prominence, even
higher than is admitted by Erdmann and
Ueberweg. This may be readily perceived
by referring to the dissertation on Franz
Baader, by Carl Philipp Fischer, of Erlangen,
and still more by having recourse to
Hamberger, Lutterbeck, and to my own
writings.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c006'>I take the liberty of recommending to
you and to the members of the Philosophical
Society of St. Louis, the study of the
works of a philosopher who certainly will
have a great future, although his doctrines
in the progress of time may undergo modifications,
reforms and further developments.
If Hegel had lived longer, the influence
of Baader upon him would have
been greater yet than became visible during
his last years. He has thrown Schelling
out of his pantheism, and pressed him
towards a semi-pantheism, or towards a
deeper theism. The influence of Baader on
the philosophers after Hegel—J. H. Fichte,
Weisse, Sempler, C. Ph. Fischer and others—is
much greater than is commonly admitted.
Whether they agree to it or not,
still it is a fact that Baader is the central
constellation of the movement of the German
spirit, from pantheism to a deeper
ideal-realistic theism. Such a genius,
whatever position may be taken with regard
to him, cannot be left unnoticed,
without running the risk of being left behind
the times. I ask nothing for Baader,
but to follow the maxim—“Try all and
keep the best.” I regret that so great a
distance prevents me from sending your
honorable Society some of my explanatory
writings, which are admitted to be clear
and thorough. It may suffice if I add a
copy of my prospectus; and let me here
remark, that a collection of my writings, in
four large volumes, will be published by
Deichert, in Erlangen. The first volume,
perhaps, will be ready at Easter, 1867.</p>

<p class='c006'>Erdmann, in his elements of the history
of philosophy, has treated of the doctrines
of Baader, too briefly it is true, but with
more justice than he has used in his former
work on the history of modern philosophy,
and he bears witness that his esteem
of Baader increases more and more. But
he evidently assigns to him a wrong position,
by considering Oken and Baader as
extremes, and Hegel as the mean, while
Oken and Hegel are the extremes, and
Baader the mean. The most important
phenomenon in the school of Hegel is
the <i>Idee der Wissenschaft</i> of Rosenkranz,
(<i>Logik und Metaphysik</i>,) which represents
Hegel in a sense not far distant
from the standpoint of Baader. * * *
* * * * C. H. Fischer’s Characteristics
of Baader’s Theosophy speaks with
high favor of him, but still I have to take
several exceptions. According to my opinion,
all the authors by him referred to, as
Schelling, Hegel, Schleiermacher, Dauber
and Baader, we must call theosophers—or
call none of them so, but <i>philosophers</i>, in
order to avoid misunderstanding. Then I
do not see how Schelling can be called
the “most genial philosopher of modern
times,” and yet Baader the more, yea, the
<i>most</i> profound. Finally, a want of system
must be admitted, but too great importance
is attributed to this. If, however, systematism
could decide here, then not Schelling
but Hegel is the greatest philosopher
of modern times. At all events Fischer’s
Memorial at the Centennial Birthday of
Baader is significant, and is written with
great spirit and warmth. The most important
work of C. Ph. Fischer, bearing on
this subject, is his elements of the system
of philosophy, or <i>Encyclopedia of the
Philosophical Sciences</i>. This is one of
the most important of the works of the
philosophers after Hegel and Baader. The
Athenäum of Froschhammer, (Journal for
Philosophy), appeared only for three years.
It had to cease its publication, because on
the one side the Ultramontanist party agitated
against it, and on the other side it
met with insufficient support. Its reissue
would be desirable, but just now not practicable,
for want of interest on the part of
the public, although it could bear comparison
with any other philosophical journal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here let me say, that from Baader there
proceeded a strong impulse toward the revival
of the study of the long-forgotten
spiritual treasures of the mystics and theosophers
of the middle ages, and of the
time of the Reformation. From this impulse
monographs have made their appearance
about Scotus Erigena, Albertus Magnus—at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>least biographies of them—Thomas
Aquinas, Meister Eckhart, Tauler, Nicholas
Cusanus, Weigel, J. Böhme, Oettinger, etc.
The most important of these I deem to be
<i>Scotus Erigena</i>, by Joh. Huber, Christlieb
and Kaulich; <i>Meister Eckhart</i>, by Bach,
and <i>J. Böhme</i>, by J. Hamberger. Bach on
<i>Eckhart</i> is especially instructive with respect
to the connection between modern
philosophy and the theosophy of Eckhart
and his school, to which also Nicholas
Cusanus belonged.</p>

<p class='c006'>I presume that it will yet be discovered
that Copernicus was at least acquainted
with Nicholas Cusanus, if he did not even
sympathize with his philosophy. The director
of the observatory at Krakau, Kerlinski,
is at present preparing a monograph
on Copernicus, which will probably
throw light on this subject. Prowe’s
pamphlet on Copernicus, which I have
noticed in Glaser’s journal, refers to the
investigations of Kerlinski, who has recently
published a beautiful edition of the
works of Copernicus. As in the early ages,
first in the Pythagorean school, they approached
the true doctrine of the Universe,
so in the middle ages it appears in the
school of Eckhart, for in a certain sense,
and with some restriction, Nicholas Cusanus
was the precursor of Copernicus.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c001'>INTRODUCTION TO THE OUTLINES OF A SYSTEM OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY; <br /> OR, <br /> ON THE IDEA OF SPECULATIVE PHYSICS AND THE INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF A SYSTEM OF THIS SCIENCE. <br /> 1799. <br /> [Translated from the German of <span class='sc'>Schelling</span>, by <span class='sc'>Tom Davidson</span>.]</h3>
<h4 class='c012'>I. <br /> WHAT WE CALL NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IS A NECESSARY SCIENCE IN THE SYSTEM OF KNOWING.</h4>
<p class='c005'>The Intelligence is productive in two
modes—that is, either blindly and unconsciously,
or freely and consciously;—unconsciously
productive in external intuition,
consciously in the creation of an ideal
world.</p>

<p class='c006'>Philosophy removes this distinction by
assuming the unconscious activity as originally
identical, and, as it were, sprung
from the same root with the conscious;
this identity is by it <i>directly</i> proved in
the case of an activity at once clearly conscious
and unconscious, which manifests
itself in the productions of genius, <i>indirectly</i>,
outside of consciousness, in the
products of <i>Nature</i>, so far as in them
all, the most complete fusion of the Ideal
with the Real is perceived.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since philosophy assumes the unconscious,
or, as it may likewise be termed, the
real activity as identical with the conscious
or ideal, its tendency will originally be to
bring back everywhere the real to the
ideal—a process which gives birth to what
is called Transcendental Philosophy. The
regularity displayed in all the movements
of Nature—for example, the sublime geometry
which is exercised in the motions
of the heavenly bodies—is not explained
by saying that Nature is the most perfect
geometry; but conversely, by saying that
the most perfect geometry is what produces
in Nature;—a mode of explanation
whereby the Real itself is transported into
the ideal world, and those motions are
changed into intuitions, which take place
only in ourselves, and to which nothing
outside of us corresponds. Again, the
fact that Nature, wherever it is left to itself,
in every transition from a fluid to a
solid state, produces, of its own accord, as
it were, regular forms—which regularity,
in the higher species of crystallization,
namely, the organic, seems to become purpose
even; or the fact that in the animal
kingdom—that product of the blind forces
of Nature—we see actions arise which are
equal in regularity to those that take place
with consciousness, and even external
works of art, perfect in their kind;—all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>this is not explained by saying that it is an
unconscious productivity, though in its
origin akin to the conscious, whose mere reflex
we see in Nature, and which, from the
stand-point of the natural view, must appear
as one and the same blind tendency,
which exerts its influence from crystallization
upwards to the highest point of organic
formation (in which, on one side,
through the art-tendency, it returns again
to mere crystallization) only acting upon
different planes.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to this view, inasmuch as Nature
is only the visible organism of our
understanding, Nature <i>can</i> produce
nothing but what shows regularity and
design, and Nature is <i>compelled</i> to produce
that. But if Nature can produce only the
regular, and produces it from necessity, it
follows that the origin of such regular and
design-evincing products must again be
capable of being proved necessary in Nature,
regarded as self-existent and real,
and in the relation of its forces;—<i>that
therefore, conversely, the Ideal must arise
out of the Real, and admit of explanation
from it</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, now, it is the task of Transcendental
Philosophy to subordinate the Real to the
Ideal, it is, on the other hand, the task of
Natural Philosophy to explain the Ideal
by the Real. The two sciences are
therefore but one science, whose two
problems are distinguished by the opposite
directions in which they move; moreover,
as the two directions are not only
equally possible, but equally necessary,
the same necessity attaches to both in the
system of knowing.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>II. <br /> SCIENTIFIC CHARACTER OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Natural Philosophy, as the opposite of
Transcendental Philosophy, is distinguished
from the latter chiefly by the fact
that it posits Nature (not, indeed, in so far
as it is a product, but in so far as it is at
once productive and product) as the self-existent;
whence it may be most briefly
designated as the Spinozism of Physics.
It follows naturally from this that there is
no place in this science for idealistic
methods of explanation, such as Transcendental
Philosophy is fitted to supply, from
the circumstance that for it Nature is
nothing more than the organ of self-consciousness,
and everything in Nature is
necessary merely because it is only
through the medium of such a Nature that
self-consciousness can take place; this
mode of explanation, however, is as meaningless
in the case of physics, and of our
science which occupies the same stand-point
with it, as were the old teleological
modes of explanation, and the introduction
of a universal reference to final causes
into the thereby metamorphosed science
of Nature. For every idealistic mode
of explanation, dragged out of its own
proper sphere and applied to the explanation
of Nature, degenerates into the most
adventurous nonsense, examples of which
are well known. The first maxim of all true
natural science, viz., to explain everything
by the forces of Nature, is therefore accepted
in its widest extent in our science, and
even extended to that region, at the limit
of which all interpretation of Nature has
hitherto been accustomed to stop short;
for example, to those organic phenomena
which seem to pre-suppose an analogy with
reason. For, granted that in the actions
of animals there really is something which
pre-supposes such analogy, on the principle
of realism, nothing further would follow
than that what we call reason is a mere
play of higher and necessarily unknown
natural forces. For, inasmuch as all thinking
is at last reducible to a producing and
reproducing, there is nothing impossible in
the thought that the same activity by which
Nature reproduces itself anew in each successive
phase, is reproductive in thought
through the medium of the organism (very
much in the same manner in which, through
the action and play of light, Nature, which
exists independently of it, is created immaterial,
and, as it were, for a second
time), in which circumstance it is natural
that what forms the limit of our intuitive
faculty, no longer falls within the sphere
of our intuition itself.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>III. <br /> NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IS SPECULATIVE PHYSICS.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Our science, as far as we have gone, is
thoroughly and completely realistic; it is
therefore nothing other than Physics, it is
only <i>speculative</i> Physics; in its tendency
it is exactly what the systems of the ancient
physicists were, and what, in more
recent times, the system of the restorer of
Epicurean philosophy is, viz., Lesage’s
Mechanical Physics, by which the speculative
spirit in physics, after a long scientific
sleep, has again, for the first time, been
awakened. It cannot be shown in detail
here (for the proof itself falls within the
sphere of our science), that on the mechanical
or atomistic basis which has been
adopted by Lesage and his most successful
predecessors, the idea of speculative physics
is incapable of realization. For, inasmuch
as the first problem of this science,
that of inquiring into the <i>absolute</i> cause
of motion (without which Nature is not
in itself a finished whole), is absolutely
incapable of a mechanical solution, seeing
that mechanically motion results only
from motion <i>ad infinitum</i>, there remains
for the real construction of speculative
physics only one way open, viz., the
dynamic, which lays down that motion
arises not only from motion, but even from
rest; that, therefore, there is motion in
the rest of Nature, and that all mechanical
motion is the merely secondary and derivative
motion of that which is solely primitive
and original, and which wells forth
from the very first factors in the construction
of a nature generally (the fundamental
forces).</p>

<p class='c006'>In hereby making clear the points of
difference between our undertaking and all
those of a similar nature that have hitherto
been attempted, we have at the same time
shown the difference between speculative
physics and so-called empirical physics;
a difference which in the main may be reduced
to this, that the former occupies
itself solely and entirely with the original
causes of motion in nature, that is, solely
with the dynamical phenomena; the latter,
on the contrary, inasmuch as it never
reaches a final source of motion in nature,
deals only with the secondary motions,
and even with the original ones only as
mechanical (and therefore likewise capable
of mathematical construction). The
former, in fact, aims generally at the inner
spring-work and what is <i>non-objective</i> in
Nature; the latter, on the contrary, only at
the <i>surface</i> of Nature, and what is objective,
and, so to speak, <i>outside</i> in it.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>IV. <br /> ON THE POSSIBILITY OF SPECULATIVE PHYSICS.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Inasmuch as our inquiry is directed not
so much upon the phenomena of Nature as
upon their final grounds, and our business
is not so much to deduce the latter from
the former as the former from the latter,
our task is simply this: to erect a science
of Nature in the strictest sense of the term;
and in order to find out whether speculative
physics are possible, we must know
what belongs to the possibility of a doctrine
of Nature viewed as science.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>a</i>) The idea of knowing is here taken
in its strictest sense, and then it is easy to
see that, in this acceptation of the term, we
can be said to know objects only when they
are such that we see the principles of their
possibility, for without this insight my
whole knowledge of an object, e. g. of a
machine, with whose construction I am
unacquainted, is a mere seeing, that is, a
mere conviction of its existence, whereas
the inventor of the machine has the most
perfect knowledge of it, because he is, as
it were, the soul of the work, and because
it preëxisted in his head before he exhibited
it as a reality.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, it would certainly be impossible to
obtain a glance into the internal construction
of Nature, if an invasion of Nature
were not possible through freedom. It is
true that Nature acts openly and freely;
its acts however are never isolated, but
performed under a concurrence of a host of
causes, which must first be excluded if we
are to obtain a pure result. Nature must
therefore be compelled to act under certain
definite conditions, which either do not exist
in it at all, or else exist only as modified by
others.—Such an invasion of Nature we
call an experiment. Every experiment is
a question put to Nature, to which she is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>compelled to give a reply. But every question
contains an implicit <i>à priori</i> judgment;
every experiment that is an experiment,
is a prophecy; experimenting itself
is a production of phenomena. The first
step, therefore, towards science, at least
in the domain of physics, is taken when
we ourselves begin to produce the objects
of that science.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b</i>) We <i>know</i> only the self-produced;
knowing, therefore, in the <i>strictest</i> acceptation
of the term, is a <i>pure</i> knowing <i>à priori</i>.
Construction by means of experiment, is,
after all, an absolute self-production of the
phenomena. There is no question but
that much in the science of Nature may
be known comparatively <i>à priori</i>; as, for
example, in the theory of the phenomena
of electricity, magnetism, and even light.
There is such a simple law recurring in
every phenomenon that the results of every
experiment may be told beforehand; here
my knowing follows immediately from a
known law, without the intervention of
any particular experience. But whence
then does the law itself come to me? The
assertion is, that all phenomena are correlated
in one absolute and necessary law,
from which they can all be deduced; in
short, that in natural science all that we
know, we know absolutely <i>à priori</i>. Now,
that experiment never leads to such a
knowing, is plainly manifest, from the fact
that it can never get beyond the forces of
Nature, of which itself makes use as means.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the final causes of natural phenomena
are themselves not phenomenal, we
must either give up all attempt ever to arrive
at a knowledge of them, or else we
must altogether put them into Nature, endow
Nature with them. But now, that
which we put into Nature has no other
value than that of a pre-supposition (hypothesis),
and the science founded thereon
must be equally hypothetical with the principle
itself. This it would be possible to
avoid only in one case, viz., if that pre-supposition
itself were involuntary, and
as necessary as Nature itself. Assuming,
for example, what must be assumed,
that the sum of phenomena is not a
mere world, but of necessity a Nature—that
is, that this whole is not merely a
product, but at the same time productive, it
follows that in this whole we can never arrive
at absolute identity, inasmuch as this
would bring about an absolute transition
of Nature, in as far as it is productive,
into Nature as product, that is, it would
produce absolute rest; such wavering of
Nature, therefore, between productivity
and product, will, of necessity, appear
as a universal duplicity of principles,
whereby Nature is maintained in continual
activity, and prevented from exhausting
itself in its product; and universal
duality as the principle of explanation
of Nature will be as necessary as the idea
of Nature itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>This absolute hypothesis must carry its
necessity within itself, but it must, besides
this, be brought to empiric proof; for, inasmuch
as all the phenomena of Nature
cannot be deduced from this hypothesis as
long as there is in the whole system of
Nature a single phenomenon which is not
necessary according to that principle, or
which contradicts it, the hypothesis is
thereby at once shown to be false, and
from that moment ceases to have validity
as an hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this deduction of all natural phenomena
from an absolute hypothesis, our
knowing is changed into a construction of
Nature itself, that is, into a science of Nature
<i>à priori</i>. If, therefore, such deduction
itself is possible, a thing which can
be proved only by the fact, then also a
doctrine of Nature is possible as a science
of Nature; a system of purely speculative
physics is possible, which was the point
to be proved.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Remark.</i>—There would be no necessity
for this remark, if the confusion which
still prevails in regard to ideas perspicuous
enough in themselves did not render
some explanation with regard to them requisite.</p>

<p class='c006'>The assertion that natural science must
be able to deduce all its principles <i>à priori</i>,
is in a measure understood to mean that
natural science must dispense with all experience,
and, without any intervention of
experience, be able to spin all its principles
out of itself—an affirmation so absurd
that the very objections to it deserve pity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span><i>Not only do we know this or that through
experience, but we originally know nothing
at all except through experience, and by
means of experience</i>, and in this sense the
whole of our knowledge consists of the
data of experience. These data become
<i>à priori</i> principles when we become conscious
of them as necessary, and thus
every datum, be its import what it may,
may be raised to that dignity, inasmuch
as the distinction between <i>à priori</i> and <i>à
posteriori</i> data is not at all, as many people
may have imagined, one originally cleaving
to the data themselves, but is a distinction
made solely <i>with respect to our knowing</i>,
and the <i>kind</i> of our knowledge of these
data, so that every datum which is merely
historical for me—i. e. a datum of experience—becomes,
notwithstanding, an <i>à priori</i>
principle as soon as I arrive, whether
directly or indirectly, at insight into its
internal necessity. Now, however, it must
in all cases be possible to recognize every
natural phenomenon as absolutely necessary;
for, if there is no chance in nature
at all, there can likewise be no original
phenomenon of Nature fortuitous; on
the contrary, for the very reason that Nature
is a system, there must be a necessary
connection for everything that happens
or comes to pass in it, in some principle
embracing the whole of Nature. Insight
into this internal necessity of all natural
phenomena becomes, of course, still more
complete, as soon as we reflect that there is
no real system which is not, at the same
time, an organic whole. For if, in an organic
whole, all things mutually bear and
support each other, then this organization
must have existed as a whole previous to
its parts—the whole could not have arisen
from the parts, but the parts must have
arisen out of the whole. <i>It is not, therefore</i>,
<span class='fss'>WE KNOW</span> <i>Nature, but Nature</i> <span class='fss'>IS</span>, <i>à
priori</i>, that is, everything individual in
it is predetermined by the whole or by the
idea of a Nature generally. But if Nature
<i>is</i> <i>à priori</i>, then it must be possible to <i>recognize</i>
it <i>as</i> something that is <i>à priori</i>,
and this is really the meaning of our affirmation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a science, like every other, does
not deal with the hypothetical, or the
merely probable, but depends upon the
evident and the certain. Now, we may indeed
be quite certain that every natural
phenomenon, through whatever number of
intermediate links, stands in connection
with the last conditions of a Nature; the
intermediate links themselves, however,
may be unknown to us, and still lying hidden
in the depths of Nature. To find out
these links is the work of experimental research.
Speculative physics have nothing
to do but to show the need of these intermediate
links;<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a> but as every new discovery
throws us back upon a new ignorance, and
while one knot is being loosed a new one
is being tied, it is conceivable that the
complete discovery of all the intermediate
links in the chain of Nature, and therefore
also our science itself, is an infinite
task. Nothing, however, has more impeded
the infinite progress of this science
than the arbitrariness of the fictions
by which the want of profound insight
was so long doomed to be concealed.
This fragmentary nature of our knowledge
becomes apparent only when we separate
what is merely hypothetical from the pure
out-come of science, and thereupon set
out to collect the fragments of the great
whole of Nature again into a system. It
is, therefore, conceivable that speculative
physics (the soul of real experiment) has,
in all time, been the mother of all great
discoveries in Nature.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>V. <br /> OF A SYSTEM OF SPECULATIVE PHYSICS GENERALLY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Hitherto the idea of speculative physics
has been deduced and developed; it is
another business to show how this idea
must be realized and actually carried out.</p>

<p class='c006'>The author, for this purpose, would at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>once refer to his Outlines of a System of
Natural Philosophy, if he had not reason to
suspect that many even of those who might
consider those Outlines worthy of their attention,
would come to it with certain preconceived
ideas, which he has not presupposed,
and which he does not desire to
have pre-supposed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The causes which may render an insight
into the tendency of those Outlines difficult,
are (exclusive of defects of style and arrangement)
mainly, the following:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That many persons, misled perhaps
by the word <i>Natural Philosophy</i>, expect to
find transcendental deductions from natural
phenomena, such as, in different fragments,
exist elsewhere, and will regard
natural philosophy generally as a part of
transcendental philosophy, whereas it forms
a science altogether peculiar, altogether
different from, and independent of, every
other.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That the notions of dynamical physics
hitherto diffused, are very different from,
and partially at variance with, those which
the author lays down. I do not speak of
the modes of representation which several
persons, whose business is really mere experiment,
have figured to themselves in
this connection; for example, where they
suppose it to be a dynamical explanation,
when they reject a galvanic fluid, and accept
instead of it certain vibrations in the
metals; for these persons, as soon as they
observe that they have understood nothing
of the matter, will revert, of their own
accord, to their previous representations,
which were made for them. I speak of
the modes of representation which have
been put into philosophic heads by Kant,
and which may be mainly reduced to this:
that we see in matter nothing but the occupation
of space in definite degrees, in
all difference of matter, therefore, only
mere difference of occupation of space (i.
e. density,) in all dynamic (qualitative)
changes, only mere changes in the relation
of the repelling and attracting forces.
Now, according to this mode of representation,
all the phenomena of Nature are
looked at only on their lowest plane, and
the dynamical physics of these philosophers
begin precisely at the point where
they ought properly to leave off. It is indeed
certain that the last result of every
dynamical process is a changed degree of
occupation of space—that is, a changed
density; inasmuch, now, as the dynamical
process of Nature is one, and
the individual dynamical processes are
only shreds of the one fundamental process—even
magnetic and electric phenomena,
viewed from this stand-point,
will be, not actions of particular materials,
but changes in the constitution of matter
itself; and as this depends upon the mutual
action of the fundamental forces, at
last, changes in the relation of the fundamental
forces themselves. We do not
indeed deny that these phenomena at the
extreme limit of their manifestation are
changes in the relation of the principles
themselves; we only deny that these
changes are nothing more; on the contrary,
we are convinced that this so-called dynamical
principle is too superficial and defective
a basis of explanation for all Nature’s
phenomena, to reach the real depth and
manifoldness of natural phenomena, inasmuch
as by means of it, in point of fact, no
qualitative change of matter <i>as</i> such is constructible
(for change of density is only the
external phenomenon of a higher change).
To adduce proof of this assertion is not
incumbent upon us, till, from the opposite
side, that principle of explanation is shown
by actual fact to exhaust Nature, and the
great chasm is filled up between that kind
of dynamical philosophy and the empirical
attainments of physics—as, for example,
in regard to the very different kinds
of effects exhibited by simple substances—a
thing which, let us say at once, we consider
to be impossible.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may therefore be permitted, in the
room of the hitherto prevailing dynamic
mode of representation, to place our own
without further remark—a procedure which
will no doubt clearly show wherein the
latter differs from the former, and by which
of the two the Doctrine of Nature may
most certainly be raised to a Science of
Nature.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>VI. <br /> INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF THE SYSTEM OF SPECULATIVE PHYSICS.</h4>
</div>
<h4 class='c012'>1.</h4>
<p class='c005'>An inquiry into the Principle of speculative
physics must be preceded by inquiries
into the distinction between the
speculative and the empirical generally.
This depends mainly upon the conviction
that between empiricism and theory there
is such a complete opposition that there
can be no third thing in which the two
may be united; that, therefore, the idea
of Experimental Science is a mongrel idea,
which implies no connected thought, or
rather, which cannot be thought at all.
What is pure empiricism is not science,
and, <i>vice versâ</i>, what is science is not empiricism.
This is not said for the purpose
of at all depreciating empiricism, but
is meant to exhibit it in its true and
proper light. Pure empiricism, be its object
what it may, is history (the absolute
opposite of theory), and, conversely, history
alone is empiricism.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Physics, as empiricism, are nothing but
a collection of facts, of accounts of what
has been observed—what has happened
under natural or artificial circumstances.
In what we at present designate physics,
empiricism and science run riot together,
and for that very reason they are neither
one thing nor another.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our aim, in view of this object, is to
separate science and empiricism as soul
and body, and by admitting nothing into
science which is not susceptible of an <i>à priori</i>
construction, to strip empiricism of all
theory, and restore it to its original nakedness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The opposition between empiricism and
science rests therefore upon this: that the
former regards its object in <i>being</i>—as something
already prepared and accomplished;
science, on the other hand, views its object
in <i>becoming</i>, and as something that
has yet to be accomplished. As science
cannot set out from anything that is a
product—that is, a thing—it must set out
from the unconditioned; the first inquiry
of speculative physics is that which relates
to the unconditioned in natural science.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>2.</h4>
<p class='c005'>As this inquiry is, in the Outlines, deduced
from the highest principles, the
following may be regarded as merely an
illustration of those inquiries:</p>

<p class='c006'>Inasmuch as everything of which we can
say that it <i>is</i>, is of a conditioned nature,
it is only <i>being itself</i> that can be the unconditioned.
But seeing that individual
being, as a conditioned, can be thought
only as a particular limitation of the productive
activity (the sole and last substrate
of all reality) <i>being itself</i> is
<i>thought</i> as the same productive activity
<i>in its unlimitedness</i>. For the philosophy
of nature, therefore, nature is originally
only productivity, and from this as its
principle science must set out.</p>

<p class='c006'>So long as we know the totality of objects
only as the sum of being, this totality
is a mere world—that is, a mere product
for us. It would certainly be impossible
in the science of Nature to rise to a higher
idea than that of being, if all permanence
(which is thought in the idea of being)
were not deceptive, and really a continuous
and uniform reproduction.</p>

<p class='c006'>In so far as we regard the totality of
objects not merely as a product, but at
the same time necessarily as productive, it
rises into <i>Nature</i> for us, and this <i>identity
of the product and the productivity</i>, and
this alone is implied, even in the ordinary
use of language by the idea of Nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nature as a mere product (<i>natura naturata</i>)
we call Nature as object (with this
alone all empiricism deals). Nature as
productivity (<i>natura naturans</i>) we call
Nature as subject (with this alone all theory
deals).</p>

<p class='c006'>As the object is never unconditioned,
something absolutely non-objective must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>be put into Nature; this absolutely non-objective
is nothing else but that original
productivity of Nature. In the ordinary
view it vanishes in the product: conversely
in the philosophic view the product vanishes
in the productivity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such identity of the product and the
productivity in the original conception of
Nature is expressed by the ordinary views
of Nature as a whole, which is at once the
cause and the effect of itself, and is in its
duplicity (which goes through all phenomena)
again identical. Furthermore, with
this idea the identity of the Real and the
Ideal agrees—an identity which is thought
in the idea of every product of Nature,
and in view of which alone the nature of
art can be placed in opposition thereto.
For whereas in art the idea precedes the
act—the execution—in Nature idea and
act are rather contemporary and one; the
idea passes immediately over into the
product, and cannot be separated from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>This identity is cancelled by the empirical
view, which sees in Nature only the
effect (although on account of the continual
wandering of empiricism into the
field of science, we have, even in purely
empirical physics, maxims which presuppose
an idea of Nature as subject—as, for
example, Nature chooses the shortest way;
Nature is sparing in causes and lavish in
effects); it is also cancelled by speculation,
which looks only at <i>cause</i> in Nature.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>3.</h4>
<p class='c005'>We can say of Nature as object that it
<i>is</i>, not of Nature as subject; for this is
being or productivity.</p>

<p class='c006'>This absolute productivity must pass
over into an empirical nature. In the idea
of absolute productivity, is the thought of
an ideal infinity. The ideal infinity must
become an empirical one.</p>

<p class='c006'>But empirical infinity is an infinite becoming.
Every infinite series is but the
exhibition of an intellectual or ideal infinity.
The original infinite series (the ideal
of all infinite series) is that wherein our
intellectual infinity evolves itself, viz.,
<i>Time</i>. The activity which sustains this
series is the same as that which sustains
our consciousness; consciousness, however,
is <i>continuous</i>. Time, therefore, as the
evolution of that activity, cannot be produced
by composition. Now, as all other infinite
series are only imitations of the
originally infinite series, Time, no infinite
series can be otherwise than continuous. In
the original evolution the retarding agent
(without which the evolution would take
place with infinite rapidity) is nothing but
<i>original reflection</i>; the necessity of reflection
upon our acting in every organic
phase (continued duplicity in identity) is
the secret stroke of art whereby our being
receives <i>permanence</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Absolute continuity, therefore, exists
only for the intuition, but not for the
<i>reflection</i>. Intuition and reflection are
opposed to each other. The infinite series
is continuous for the productive <i>intuition</i>—interrupted
and composite for the
<i>reflection</i>. It is on this <i>contradiction</i> between
intuition and reflection that those
sophisms are based, in which the possibility
of all motion is contested, and which
are solved at every successive step by the
productive activity. To the intuition, for
example, the action of gravity takes place
with perfect continuity; to the reflection,
by fits and starts. Hence all the laws of
mechanics, whereby that which is properly
only the object of the productive intuition
becomes an object of reflection, are really
only laws for the reflection. Hence those
fictitious notions of mechanics, the atoms
of time in which gravitation acts, the law
that the moment of solicitation is infinitely
small, because otherwise an infinite rapidity
would be produced in finite time, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. Hence, finally, the assertion that in
mathematics no infinite series can really
be represented as continuous, but only as
advancing by fits and starts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The whole of this inquiry into the opposition
between reflection and the productivity
of the intuition, serves only to
enable us to deduce the general statement
that in <i>all</i> productivity, and in productivity
alone, there is absolute <i>continuity</i>—a
statement of importance in the consideration
of the whole of Nature; inasmuch,
for example, as the law that in Nature
there is no leap, that there is a continuity
of forms in it, &amp;c., is confined to the original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>productivity of Nature, in which
certainly there must be continuity, whereas
from the stand-point of reflection all
things must appear <i>disconnected</i> and <i>without</i>
continuity—placed beside each other,
as it were; we must therefore admit that
both parties are right; those, namely, who
assert continuity in Nature—for example,
in organic Nature—no less than those who
deny it, when we take into consideration
the difference of their respective stand-points;
and we thereby, at the same time,
arrive at the distinction between dynamical
and atomistic physics; for, as will
soon become apparent, the two are distinguished
only by the fact that the former
occupies the stand-point of <i>intuition</i>, the
latter that of <i>reflection</i>.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>4.</h4>
<p class='c005'>These general principles being presupposed,
we shall be able, with more certainty,
to reach our aim, and make an
exposition of the internal organism of our
system.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>a</i>) In the idea of becoming, we think
the idea of gradualness. But an absolute
productivity will exhibit itself empirically
as a becoming with infinite rapidity,
whereby there results nothing real for the
intuition.</p>

<p class='c006'>(Inasmuch as Nature must in reality be
thought as engaged in infinite evolution,
the permanence, the resting of the products
of Nature—the organic ones, for
instance—is not to be viewed as an absolute
resting, but only as an evolution proceeding
with infinitely small rapidity or
with infinite tardiness. But hitherto evolution,
with even finite rapidity, not to
speak of infinitely small rapidity, has not
been constructed.)</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b</i>) That the evolution of Nature should
take place with finite rapidity, and thus
become an object of intuition, is not
thinkable without an original limitation
(a being limited) of the productivity.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c</i>) But if Nature be absolute productivity,
then the ground of this limitation may
lie <i>outside of it</i>. Nature is originally <i>only</i>
productivity; there can, therefore, be
nothing determined in this productivity
(all determination is negation) and so
products can never be reached by it. If
products are to be reached, the productivity
must pass from being undetermined to
being determined—that is, it must, as
pure productivity, be cancelled. If now
the ground of determination of productivity
lay outside of Nature, Nature would not
be originally absolutely productivity. Determination,
that is, negation, must certainly
come into Nature; but this negation,
viewed from a higher stand-point, must
again be positivity.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>d</i>) But if the ground of this limitation
lies <i>within Nature itself</i>, then Nature
ceases to be <i>pure identity</i>. (Nature, in
so far as it is only productivity, is pure
identity, and there is in it absolutely
nothing capable of being distinguished.
In order that anything may be distinguished
in it, its identity must be cancelled—Nature
must not be identity, but
duplicity.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Nature must originally be an object to
itself; this change of the pure subject
into a self-object is unthinkable without
an original sundering in Nature itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>This duplicity cannot therefore be further
deduced physically; for, as the condition
of all Nature generally, it is the
principle of all physical explanation, and
all physical explanation can only have for
its aim the reduction of all the antitheses
which appear in Nature to that original
antithesis in the heart of Nature,
<i>which does not, however, itself appear</i>.
Why is there no original phenomenon of
Nature without this duplicity, if in Nature
all things are not mutually subject and object
to each other <i>ad infinitum</i>, and Nature
even, in its origin, at once product and
productive?</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>e</i>) If Nature is originally duplicity,
there must be opposite tendencies even in
the original productivity of Nature. (The
positive tendency must be opposed by
another, which is, as it were, anti-productive—retarding
production; not as the
contradictory, but as the negative—the
really opposite of the former.) It is only
then that, in spite of its being limited,
there is no passivity in Nature, when even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>that which limits it is again positive, and
its original duplicity is a contest of really
opposite tendencies.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>f</i>) In order to arrive at a product,
these opposite tendencies must concur.
But as they are supposed equal, (for there
is no ground for supposing them unequal,)
wherever they meet they will annihilate
each other; the product is therefore = 0,
and once more no product is reached.</p>

<p class='c006'>This inevitable, though hitherto not very
closely remarked contradiction (namely,
that a product can arise only through the
concurrence of opposite tendencies, while
at the same time these opposite tendencies
mutually annihilate each other) is capable
of being solved only in the following manner:
There is absolutely no <i>subsistence</i> of
a product thinkable, <i>without a continual
process of being reproduced</i>. The product
must be thought as <i>annihilated at every
step</i>, and at <i>every step reproduced anew</i>.
We do not really see the subsisting of a
product, but only the continual process of
being reproduced.</p>

<p class='c006'>(It is of course very conceivable how the
series 1-1+1-1... on to infinity is
thought as equal neither to 1 nor to 0.
The reason however why this series is
thought as =1/2 lies deeper. There is one
absolute magnitude (=1), which, though
continually annihilated in this series, continually
recurs, and by this recurrence
produces, not itself, but the mean between
itself and nothing.—Nature, as object, is
that which comes to pass in such an infinite
series, and is = a fraction of the
original unit, to which the never cancelled
duplicity supplies the numerator.)</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>g</i>) If the subsistence of the product is
a continual process of being reproduced,
then all <i>persistence</i> also is only in nature
as <i>object</i>; in nature as <i>subject</i> there is
only infinite <i>activity</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The product is originally nothing but a
mere point, a mere limit, and it is only
from Nature’s combatting against this
point that it is, so to speak, raised to a
full sphere—to a product. (Suppose, for
illustration, a stream; it is <i>pure identity</i>;
where it meets resistance, there is formed
a whirlpool; this whirlpool is not anything
abiding, but something that every moment
vanishes, and every moment springs up
anew.—In Nature there is originally nothing
distinguishable; all products are, so to
speak, still in solution, and invisible in the
universal productivity. It is only when
retarding points are given, that they are
thrown off and advance out of the universal
identity.—At every such point the
stream breaks (the productivity is annihilated),
but at every step there comes a
new wave which fills up the sphere).</p>

<p class='c006'>The philosophy of nature has not to explain
the productive (side) of nature; for if
it does not posit this as in nature originally,
it will never bring it into nature. It has
to explain the permanent. But the fact
<i>that</i> anything should become permanent in
nature, can itself receive its explanation
only from that contest of nature <i>against
all permanence</i>. The products would appear
as mere points, if nature did not give
them extension and depth by its own pressure,
and the products themselves would
last only an instant, if nature did not at
every instant crowd up against them.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>h</i>) This seeming product, which is reproduced
at every step, cannot be a
really infinite product; for otherwise productivity
would actually exhaust itself in it;
in like manner it cannot be a finite product;
for it is the force of the whole of
nature that pours itself into it. It must
therefore be at once infinite and finite; it
must be only seemingly finite, but in infinite
development.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c006'>The point at which this product originally
comes in, is the universal point of
retardation in nature, the point from which
all evolution in nature begins. But in
nature, as it is evolved, this point lies not
here or there, but everywhere where there
is a product.</p>

<p class='c006'>This product is a finite one, but as the
infinite productivity of nature concentrates
itself in it, it must have a tendency to infinite
development.—And thus gradually,
and through all the foregoing intermediate
links, we have arrived at the construction
of that infinite becoming—the empirical
exhibition of an ideal infinity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>We behold in what is called nature (i. e.
in this assemblage of individual objects),
not the primal product itself, but its evolution,
(hence the point of retardation cannot
remain <i>one</i>.)—By what means <i>this</i> evolution
is again absolutely retarded, which
must happen, if we are to arrive at a fixed
product, has not yet been explained.</p>

<p class='c006'>But through this product an original infinity
evolves itself; this infinity can never
decrease. The magnitude which evolves
itself in an infinite series, is still infinite
at every point of the line; and thus nature
will be still infinite at every point of the
evolution.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is only one original point of retardation
to productivity; but any number
of points of retardation to evolution
may be thought. Every such point is
marked for us by a product; but at every
point of the evolution nature is still infinite;
therefore nature is still infinite in
every product, and in every one lies the
germ of a universe.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>(The question, by what means the infinite
tendency is retarded in the product, is
still unanswered. The original retardation
in the productivity of nature, explains
only why the evolution takes place with
finite rapidity, but not why it takes place
with infinitely small rapidity.)</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>i</i>) The product evolves itself <i>ad infinitum</i>.
In this evolution, therefore, nothing
can happen, which is not already a product
(synthesis), and which might not divide
up into new factors, each of these
again having its factors.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus even by an analysis pursued <i>ad
infinitum</i>, we could never arrive at anything
in nature which should be absolutely
simple.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>k</i>) If however we <i>suppose</i> the evolution
as completed, (although it <i>never</i> can be
completed,) still the evolution could not
stop at anything which was a product, but
only at the purely productive.</p>

<p class='c006'>The question arises, whether a final,
such that it is no longer a substrate,
but the cause of all substrate, no
longer a product, but absolutely productive—we
will not say <i>occurs</i>, for that is
unthinkable, but—can at least be proved
in experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>l</i>) Inasmuch as it bears the character
of the unconditioned, it would have to exhibit
itself as something, which, although
itself not in space, is still the principle of
all occupation of space.</p>

<p class='c006'>What occupies space is not matter, for
matter is the occupied space itself. That,
therefore, which occupies space cannot be
matter. Only that which is, is in space,
not <i>being itself</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is self-evident that no positive external
intuition is possible of that which <i>is</i>
not in space. It would therefore have to
be capable of being exhibited negatively.
This happens in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c006'>That which is in space, is, as such,
mechanically and chemically destructible.
That which is not destructible either mechanically
or chemically must therefore
lie outside of space. But it is only the
final ground of all quality that has anything
of this nature; for although one quality
may be extinguished by another, this
can nevertheless only happen in a third
product, C, for the formation and maintenance
of which A and B, (the opposite
factors of C,) must continue to act.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this indestructible (somewhat),
which is thinkable only as pure intensity,
is, as the cause of all substrate, at the
same time the principle of divisibility <i>ad
infinitum</i>. (A body, divided <i>ad infinitum</i>
still occupies space in the same degree
with its smallest part.)</p>

<p class='c006'>That, therefore, which is purely productive
without being a product, is but the
final ground of quality. But every quality
is a determinate one, whereas productivity
is originally indeterminate. In the qualities,
therefore, productivity appears as already
retarded, and as it appears most
original in them generally, it appears in
them most originally retarded.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>This is the point at which our mode of
conception diverges from those of the currently
so-called dynamical physics.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our assertion, briefly stated, is this:—If
the infinite evolution of nature were
completed (which is impossible) it would
separate up into original and simple actions,
or, if we may so express ourselves,
into simple productivities. Our assertion
therefore is not: There are in nature such
simple actions; but only, they are the
ideal grounds of the explanation of quality.
These <i>entelechies</i> cannot actually be
shown, they do not <i>exist</i>; we have not
therefore to explain here anything more
than is asserted, namely, that such original
productivities must be <i>thought</i> as the
grounds of the explanation of all quality.
This proof is as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>The affirmation that nothing which <i>is</i> in
space, that is, that nothing at all is
mechanically simple, requires no demonstration.
That, therefore, which is in reality
simple, cannot be thought as in space,
but must be thought as outside of space.
But outside of space only pure intensity is
thought. This idea of pure intensity is
expressed by the idea of action. It is not
the product of this action that is simple,
but the action itself abstracted from the
product, and it must be simple in order that
the product may be divisible <i>ad infinitum</i>.
For although the parts are near vanishing,
the intensity must still remain. And this
pure intensity is what, even in infinite divisibility,
sustains the substrate.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, therefore, the assertion that affirms
something simple as the basis of the explanation
of quality is atomistic, then our
philosophy is atomistic. But, inasmuch
as it places the simple in something that
is only productive without being a product,
it is <i>dynamical atomistics</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This much is clear, that if we admit an
absolute division of nature into its factors,
the last (thing) that remains over, must be
something, which absolutely defies all division,
that is, the simple. But the simple
can be thought only as dynamical,
and as such it is not in space at all (it
designates only what is thought as altogether
outside of space-occupation); there
is therefore no intuition of it possible, except
through its product. In like manner
there is no measure for it given but its
product. For to pure thought it is the
mere <i>origin</i> of the product (as the point is
only the origin of the line), in one word
pure <i>entelechy</i>. But that which is known,
not in itself, but only in its product, is
known altogether empirically. If, therefore,
every original quality, as quality
(not as substrate, in which quality
merely inheres), must be thought as pure
intensity, pure action, then qualities generally
are only the absolutely empirical in
our knowledge of nature, of which no construction
is possible, and in respect to
which there remains nothing of the philosophy
of nature, save the proof that they
are the absolute limit of its construction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The question in reference to the ground
of quality posits the evolution of nature
as completed, that is, it posits something
merely thought, and therefore can be answered
only by an ideal ground of explanation.
This question adopts the stand-point
of reflection (on the product), whereas
genuine dynamics always remain on the
stand-point of intuition.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must here, however, be at once remarked
that if the ground of the explanation
of quality is conceived as an ideal
one, the question only regards the explanations
of quality, in so far as it is thought
as absolute. There is no question, for instance,
of quality, in so far as it shows
itself in the dynamical process. For quality,
so far as it is relative, there is certainly
a [not merely ideal, but actually
real] ground of explanation and determination;
quality in that case is determined
by its opposite, with which it is placed in
conflict, and this antithesis is itself again
determined by a higher antithesis, and so
on back into infinity; so that, if this universal
organization could dissolve itself, all
matter likewise would sink back into dynamical
inactivity, that is, into absolute
defect of quality. (Quality is a higher
power of matter, to which the latter elevates
itself by reciprocity.) It is demonstrated
in the sequel that the dynamical
process is a limited one for each individual
sphere; because it is only thereby that
definite points of relation for the determination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>of quality arise. This limitation
of the dynamical process, that is, the
proper determination of quality, takes
place by means of no force other than that
by which the evolution is universally and
absolutely limited, and this negative element
is the only one in things that is indivisible,
and mastered by nothing.—The
absolute relativity of all quality may be
shown from the electric relation of bodies,
inasmuch as the same body that is positive
with one is negative with another,
and conversely. But we might now
henceforth abide by the statement (which
is also laid down in the Outlines): <i>All quality
is electricity</i>, and conversely, <i>the electricity
of a body is also its quality</i>, (for all
difference of quality is equal to difference
of electricity, and all [chemical] quality is
reducible to electricity).—Everything that
is sensible for us (sensible in the narrower
acceptation of the term, as colors,
taste, &amp;c.), is doubtless sensible to us
only <i>through</i> electricity, and the only <i>immediately</i>
sensible (element) would then
be electricity,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> a conclusion to which the
universal duality of every sense leads us
independently, inasmuch as in Nature there
is properly only one duality. In galvanism,
sensibility, as a reagent, reduces all quality
of bodies, for which it is a reagent to
an original difference. All bodies which,
in a chain, at all affect the sense of taste
or that of sight, be their differences ever
so great, are either alkaline or acid, excite
a negative or positive shock, and here they
always appear as active in a higher than
the merely chemical power.</p>

<p class='c006'>Quality considered as absolute is inconstructible,
because quality generally is not
anything absolute, and there is no other
quality at all, save that which bodies
show mutually in relation to each other,
and all quantity is something in virtue of
which the body is, so to speak, raised
above itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>All hitherto attempted construction of
quality reduces itself to the two attempts;
to express qualities by figures, and so, for
each original quality, to assume a particular
figure in Nature; or else, to express
quality by analytical formulæ (in which
the forces of attraction and repulsion supply
the negative and positive magnitudes.)
To convince oneself of the futility of this
attempt, the shortest method is to appeal
to the emptiness of the explanations to
which it gives rise. Hence we limit ourselves
here to the single remark, that
through the construction of all matter out
of the two fundamental forces, different
degrees of density may indeed be constructed,
but certainly never different qualities
as qualities; for although all dynamical
(qualitative) changes appear, in their
lowest stage, as changes of the fundamental
forces, yet we see at that stage
only the product of the process—not the
<i>process itself</i>—and those changes are <i>what
require explanation</i>, and the ground of explanation
must therefore certainly be
sought in something higher.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only possible ground of explanation
for quality is an ideal one; because this
ground itself presupposes something
purely ideal. If any one inquire into the
final ground of quality, he transports himself
back to the starting point of Nature.
But where is this starting point? and does
not all quality consist in this, that matter
is prevented by the general concatenation
from reverting into its originality?</p>

<p class='c006'>From the point at which reflection and
intuition separate, a separation, be it remarked,
which is possible only on the hypothesis
of the evolutions being complete,
physics divide into the two opposite directions,
into which the two systems, the
atomistic and the dynamical, have been
divided.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>dynamical</i> system <i>denies</i> the absolute
evolution of Nature, and passes from
Nature as synthesis (i. e. Nature as subject)
to Nature as evolution (i. e. Nature
as object); the atomistic system passes
from the evolution, as the original, to Nature
as synthesis; the former passes from
the stand-point of intuition to that of reflection;
the latter from the stand-point
of reflection to that of intuition.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Both directions are equally possible. If
the analysis only is right, then the synthesis
must be capable of being found
again through analysis, just as the analysis
in its turn can be found through the
synthesis. But whether the analysis is
correct can be tested only by the fact that
we can pass from it again to the synthesis.
The synthesis therefore is, and continues,
the absolutely presupposed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The problems of the one system turn
exactly round into those of the other;
that which, in atomical physics, is the
cause of the <i>composition</i> of Nature is, in
dynamical physics, <i>that which checks evolution</i>.
The former explains the composition
of Nature by the force of cohesion,
whereby, however, no continuity is ever
introduced into it; the latter, on the contrary,
explains cohesion by the continuity
of evolution. (All cohesion is originally
only in the productivity.)</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Both systems set out from something
purely ideal.</i> Absolute synthesis is as
much purely <i>ideal</i> as absolute analysis.
The Real occurs only in Nature as <i>product</i>;
but Nature is not product, either when
thought as absolute involution or as absolute
evolution; product is what is contained
between the two extremes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first problem for both systems is to
construct the product—i. e. that wherein
those opposites become real. Both reckon
with purely <i>ideal</i> magnitudes so long as
the product is not constructed: it is only
in the <i>directions</i> in which they accomplish
this that they are opposed. Both systems,
as far as they have to deal with merely
ideal factors, have the same value, and the
one forms the test of the other.—That
which is concealed in the depths of productive
Nature must be reflected as product
in Nature as Nature, and thus the
atomistic system must be the continual
reflex of the dynamical. In the Outlines,
of the two directions, that of atomistic
physics has been chosen intentionally. It
will contribute not a little to the understanding
of our science, if we here demonstrate
in the <i>productivity</i> what was
there shown in the <i>product</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>m</i>) <i>In the pure productivity of Nature
there is absolutely nothing distinguishable
except duality; it is only productivity
dualized in itself that gives the product.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Inasmuch as the absolute productivity
arrives only at producing <i>per se</i>, not at the
producing of a determinate [somewhat],
the tendency of Nature, in virtue of which
product is arrived at, must be the <i>negative</i>
of productivity.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Nature, in so far as it is real, there
can no more be productivity without a
product, than a product without productivity.
Nature can only approximate to the
two extremes, and it must be demonstrated
<i>that</i> it approximates to both.</p>

<p class='c006'>(α) <i>Pure productivity passes originally
into formlessness.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Wherever Nature loses itself in formlessness,
productivity exhausts itself in it.
(This is what we express when we talk of
a becoming latent.)—Conversely, wherever
the form predominates—i. e. wherever the
productivity is <i>limited</i>—the productivity
manifests itself; it appears, not as a (representable)
product, but <i>as</i> productivity,
although passing over into one product, as
in the phenomena of heat. (The idea of
imponderables is only a symbolic one.)</p>

<p class='c006'>(β) <i>If productivity passes into formlessness,
then, objectively considered, it is the
absolutely formless.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The boldness of the atomical system
has been very imperfectly comprehended.
The idea which prevails in it, of an absolutely
formless [somewhat] everywhere
incapable of manifestation as determinate
matter, is nothing other than the symbol
of nature approximating to productivity.—The
nearer to productivity the nearer to
formlessness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(γ) <i>Productivity appears as productivity
only when limits are set to it.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>That which is everywhere and in everything,
is, for that very reason, nowhere.—Productivity
is fixed only by limitation.—<i>Electricity
exists</i> only at that point at
which limits are given, and it is only a
poverty of conception that would look for
anything else in its phenomena beyond the
phenomena of (limited) productivity.—The
condition of <i>light</i> is an antithesis
in the electric and galvanic, as well as in
the chemical, process, and even light
which comes to us without our coöperation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>(the phenomenon of productivity
exerted all round by the sun) presupposes
that antithesis.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>(δ) <i>It is only limited productivity that
gives the start to product.</i> (The explanation
of product must begin at the origination
of the fixed point at which the start
is made.) <i>The condition of all formation
is duality.</i> (This is the more profound
signification that lies in Kant’s
construction of matter from opposite
forces.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Electrical phenomena are the general
scheme for the construction of matter universally.</p>

<p class='c006'>(ε) <i>In Nature, neither pure productivity
nor pure product can ever be arrived at.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The former is the negation of all product,
the latter the negation of all productivity.</p>

<p class='c006'>(Approximation to the former is the absolutely
decomposible, to the latter the absolutely
indecomposible, of the atomistics.
The former cannot be thought without, at
the same time, being the absolutely incomposible,
the latter without, at the same
time, being the absolutely composible.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Nature will therefore originally be the
middle [somewhat] arising out of the two,
and thus we arrive at the idea of <i>a productivity
engaged in a transition into product,
or of a product that is productive ad
infinitum</i>. We hold to the latter definition.</p>

<p class='c006'>The idea of the product (the fixed) and
that of the productive (the free) are mutually
opposed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Seeing that what we have postulated is
already product, it can, if it is productive
at all, be productive only in a <i>determinate
way</i>. But determined productivity is
(active) <i>formation</i>. That third [somewhat]
must therefore be <i>in the state of
formation</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the product is supposed to be productive
<i>ad infinitum</i> (that transition is
never absolutely to take place); it will
therefore at every stage be productive in a
determinate way; the productivity will
remain, but not the product.</p>

<p class='c006'>(The question might arise how a transition
from form to form is possible at all
here, when <i>no</i> form is fixed. Still, that
<i>momentary</i> forms should be reached, has
already been rendered possible by the fact
that the evolution cannot take place with
infinite rapidity, in which case, therefore,
for every step at least, the form is certainly
a determinate one.)</p>

<p class='c006'>The product will appear as in <i>infinite
metamorphosis</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(From the stand-point of reflection, as
continually on the leap from fluid to solid,
without ever reaching, however, the required
form.—Organizations that do not
live in the grosser element, at least live on
the deep ground of the aërial sea—many
pass over, by metamorphoses, from one
element into another; and what does the
animal, whose vital functions almost all
consist in contractions, appear to be, other
than such a leap?)</p>

<p class='c006'>The metamorphosis will not possibly
take place <i>without rule</i>. For it must remain
within the original antithesis, and
is thereby confined within limits.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This accordance with rule will express
itself solely by an internal relationship of
forms—a relationship which again is not
thinkable without an archetype which lies
at the basis of all, and which, with however
manifold divergences, they nevertheless
all express.</p>

<p class='c006'>But even with such a product, we have
not that which we were in quest of—a
product which, while productive <i>ad infinitum</i>,
remains <i>the same</i>. That this product
should remain the same seems unthinkable,
because it is not thinkable without
an absolute checking or suppression of the
productivity.—The product would have to
be checked, as the productivity was
checked, for it is still productive—checked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>by dualization and limitation resulting
therefrom. But it must at the same time
be explained how the productive product
can be checked at each individual stage of
its formation, without its ceasing to be
productive, or how, <i>by dualization itself
the permanence of the productivity is secured</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this way we have brought the reader
as far as the problem of the fourth section
of the Outlines, and we leave him to
find in it for himself the solution along
with the corollaries which it brings up.—Meanwhile,
we shall endeavor to indicate
how the deduced product would necessarily
appear from the stand-point of <i>reflection</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The product is the synthesis wherein
the opposite extremes meet, which on the
one side are designated by the absolutely
decomposible—on the other as indecomposible.—How
continuity comes into the
absolute discontinuity with which he sets
out, the atomic philosopher endeavors to
explain by means of cohesive, plastic
power, &amp;c., &amp;c. In vain, for continuity is
only <i>productivity</i> itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>The manifoldness of the forms which
such product assumes in its metamorphosis
was explained by the difference in the
stages of development, so that, parallel
with every step of development, goes a
particular form. The atomic philosopher
posits in nature certain fundamental forms,
and as in it everything strives after form,
and every thing which does form itself has
also its <i>particular</i> form, so the fundamental
forms must be conceded, but certainly
only as indicated in nature, not as
actually existent.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the standpoint of reflection, the
becoming of this product must appear as
a continual striving of the original actions
toward the production of a determinate
form, and a continual recancelling of those
forms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, the product would not be product
of a simple tendency; it would be only
the visible expression of an internal proportion,
of an internal equipoise of the
original actions, which neither reduce
themselves mutually to absolute formlessness,
nor yet, by reason of the universal
conflict, allow the production of a determinate
and fixed form.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hitherto (so long as we have had to deal
merely with ideal factors), there have
been opposite directions of investigation
possible; from this point, inasmuch as we
have to pursue a real product in its developments,
there is only one direction.</p>

<p class='c006'>(η) By the unavoidable separation of
productivity into opposite directions at
every single step of development the product
itself is separated into <i>individual
products</i>, by which, however, for that very
reason, only different stages of development
are marked.</p>

<p class='c006'>That this is so may be shown <i>either</i> in
the products themselves, as is done when
we compare them with each other with
regard to their form, and search out a continuity
of formation—an idea which, from
the fact that continuity is never in the
<i>products</i> (for the reflection), but always
only in the <i>productivity</i>, can never be perfectly
realized.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to find continuity in productivity,
the successive steps of the <i>transition
of productivity into product</i> must be
more clearly exhibited than they have
hitherto been. From the fact that the
productivity gets <i>limited</i>, (<i>v. supra</i>,) we
have in the first instance only the start for
a product, only the fixed point for the productivity
generally. It must be shown
<i>how</i> the productivity gradually materializes
itself, and changes itself into products
ever more and more fixed, so as to produce
a <i>dynamical scale in nature</i>, and this is
the real subject of the fundamental problem
of the whole system.</p>

<p class='c006'>In advance, the following may serve to
throw light on the subject. In the first
place, a dualization of the productivity is
demanded; the cause through which this
dualization is effected remains in the first
instance altogether outside of the investigation.
By dualization a change of contraction
and expansion is perhaps conditioned.
This change is not something
in matter, but is <i>matter itself</i>, and the first
stage of productivity passing over into
product. <i>Product</i> cannot be reached except
through a stoppage of this change,
that is, through a third [somewhat] which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span><i>fixes</i> that change itself, and thus matter in
its lowest stage—in the <i>first</i> power—would
be an object of intuition; that change
would be seen in rest, or in equipoise, just
as, conversely again, by the suppression of
the third [somewhat] matter might be
raised to a higher power. Now it might
be possible that those products just deduced
stood upon <i>quite different degrees</i> of
materiality, or of <i>that transition</i>, or that
those different degrees were more or less
<i>distinguishable</i> in the one than in the other;
that is, a dynamical scale of those products
would thereby have to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>o</i>) In the <i>solution</i> of the problem itself,
we shall continue, in the first instance, in
the direction hitherto taken, without knowing
where it may lead us.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are individual products brought
into nature; but in these products productivity,
<i>as</i> productivity, is held to be still
always distinguishable. Productivity has
not yet absolutely passed over into product.
The subsistence of the product is
supposed to be a continual self-reproduction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The problem arises: By what is this
absolute transition—exhaustion of the productivity
in the product—prevented? or
by what does its subsistence become a continual
self-reproduction?</p>

<p class='c006'>It is absolutely unthinkable how the
activity that everywhere tends towards a
product is prevented from going over into
it <i>entirely</i>, unless that transition is prevented
<i>by external influences</i>, and the product,
if it is to subsist, is compelled at
every step to reproduce itself <i>anew</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Up to this point, however, no trace has
been discovered of a cause opposed to the
product (to organic nature). Such a cause
can, therefore, at present, only be postulated.
We thought we saw the whole of
nature exhaust itself in that product, and
it is only here that we remark, that in order
to comprehend such product, <i>something
else</i> must be presupposed, and a new antithesis
must come into nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nature has hitherto been for us absolute
<i>identity</i> in duplicity; here we come upon
an antithesis that must again take place
<i>within</i> the other. This antithesis must be
capable of being shown in the deduced
product itself, if it is capable of being
deduced at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>The deduced product is an activity <i>directed
outwards</i>; this cannot be distinguished
as such without an activity <i>directed
inwards from without</i>, (i. e. directed
upon itself,) and this activity, on the
other hand, cannot be thought, unless it is
<i>pressed back</i> (reflected) from without.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>In the opposite directions, which arise
through this antithesis lies the principle
for the construction of all the phenomena
of life</i>—on the suppression of those opposite
directions, life remains over, either as
<i>absolute activity</i> or <i>absolute receptivity</i>,
since it is possible only as the perfect
<i>inter-determination</i> of receptivity and activity.</p>

<p class='c006'>We therefore refer the reader to the Outlines
themselves, and merely call his attention
to the higher stage of construction
which we have here reached.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have above (<i>g</i>) explained the origin
of a <i>product generally</i> by a struggle of nature
against the original point of check,
whereby this point is raised to a full
sphere, and thus receives permanence.
Here, since we are deducing a struggle of
<i>external</i> nature, not against a mere point,
but against a <i>product</i>, the first construction
rises for us to a <i>second</i> power, as it
were,—we have a double product, and thus
it might well be shown in the sequel that
organic nature generally is only the higher
power of the inorganic, and that it rises
above the latter for the very reason that in
it even that which was already product
<i>again</i> becomes product.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since the product, which we have deduced
as the most primary, drives us to a
side of nature that is opposed to it, it is
clear that our construction of the origin of
a product generally is <i>incomplete</i>, and that
we have not yet, by a long way, satisfied
our problem; (the problem of all science is
to construct the origin of a fixed product.)</p>

<p class='c006'>A productive product, as such, can subsist
only under the influence of external
forces, because it is only thereby that productivity
is interrupted—prevented from
being extinguished in the product. For
these external forces there must now again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>be a particular sphere; those forces must
lie in a world which is <i>not productive</i>. But
that world, for this very reason, would be a
world fixed and undetermined in every respect.
The problem—how a product in
nature is arrived at—has therefore received
a one-sided solution by all that has
preceded. “The product is checked by
dualization of the productivity at every
single step of development.” But this is
true only for the <i>productive</i> product,
whereas we are here treating of a <i>non-productive</i>
product.</p>

<p class='c006'>The contradiction which meets us here
can be solved only by the finding of a
<i>general</i> expression for the construction of
a <i>product generally</i>, (regardless of whether
it is productive or has ceased to be so).</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c006'>Since the existence of a world, that
is <i>not productive</i> (inorganic) is in the
first instance merely postulated, in order
to explain the productive one, so its conditions
can be laid down only hypothetically,
and as we do not in the first instance
know it at all except from its opposition
to the productive, those conditions
likewise must be deduced only from this
opposition. From this it is of course clear,—what
is also referred to in the Outlines—that
this second section, as well as the first,
contains throughout merely hypothetical
truth, since neither organic nor inorganic
nature is explained without our having reduced
the construction of the two to a common
expression, which, however, is possible
only through the synthetic part.—This must
lead to the highest and most general principles
for the construction of a <i>nature</i> generally;
hence we must refer the reader who is
concerned about a knowledge of our system
altogether to that part. The hypothetical
deduction of an inorganic world and its
conditions we may pass over here all the
more readily, that they are sufficiently detailed
in the Outlines, and hasten to the
most general and the highest problem of
our science.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c006'>The most general problem of speculative
physics may now be expressed thus: <i>To
reduce the construction of organic and inorganic
products to a common expression</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>We can state only the main principles of
such a solution, and of these, for the most
part, only such as have not been completely
educed in the Outlines themselves—(3d
principal section.)</p>
<h4 class='c012'>A.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Here at the very beginning we lay down
the principle that <i>as the organic product is
the product in the second power, the</i> <span class='fss'>ORGANIC</span>
<i>construction of the product</i> must be, <i>at
least, the sensuous image of the</i> <span class='fss'>ORIGINAL</span>
<i>construction of all product</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>a</i>) In order that the productivity may
be at all fixed at a point, <i>limits must be
given</i>. Since <i>limits</i> are the condition of
the first phenomenon, the cause whereby
limits are produced <i>cannot be a phenomenon</i>,
it goes back into the interior of nature,
or of each respective product.</p>

<p class='c006'>In organic nature, this limitation of productivity
is shown by what we call sensibility,
which must be thought as the
first condition of the construction of the
organic product.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b</i>) The immediate effect of confined productivity
is a <i>change of contraction and
expansion</i> in the matter already given, and
as we now know, constructed, as it were,
for the second time.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c</i>) Where this change stops, productivity
passes over into product, and where
it is again restored, product passes over
into productivity. For since the product
must remain productive <i>ad infinitum</i>,
<i>those three stages of productivity</i> must be
<i>capable of being</i> <span class='fss'>DISTINGUISHED</span> in the product;
the absolute transition of the latter
into product is the cancelling of product
itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>d</i>) As these three stages are distinguishable
in the <i>individual</i>, so they must be
distinguishable in <i>organic nature throughout</i>,
and the scale of organizations is nothing
more than a scale of <i>productivity itself</i>.
(Productivity exhausts itself to degree <i>c</i> in
the product <i>A</i>, and can begin with the product
<i>B</i> only at the point where it left off
with <i>A</i>, that is, with degree <i>d</i>, and so on
downwards to the <i>vanishing</i> of all productivity.
If we knew the absolute <i>degree</i> of
productivity of the <i>earth</i> for example—a
degree which is determined by the earth’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>relation to the sun—the limit of organization
upon it might be thereby more accurately
determined than by incomplete experience—which
must be incomplete for
this reason, if for no other, that the catastrophes
of nature have, beyond doubt,
swallowed the last links of the chain. A
true system of Natural History, which has
for its object not the <i>products</i> [of nature]
but <i>nature itself</i>, follows up the one productivity
that battles, so to speak, against
freedom, through all its windings and
turnings, to the point at which it is at last
compelled to perish in the product.)</p>

<p class='c006'>It is upon this dynamical scale, in the
individual, as well as in the whole of organic
nature, that the construction of all
organic phenomena rests.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>B.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a></h4>
<p class='c005'>These principles, stated universally, lead
to the following fundamental principles of
a universal theory of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>a</i>) Productivity must be <i>primarily</i> limited.
Since <i>outside</i> of limited productivity
there is [only] <i>pure identity</i> the limitation
cannot be established by a difference
already existing, and therefore must
be so by an <i>opposition</i> arising in <i>productivity
itself</i>—an opposition to which we
here revert as a first postulate.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>b</i>) This difference thought <i>purely</i> is the
first condition of all [natural] activity, the
productivity is attracted and repelled<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> between
opposites (the primary limits); in
this change of expansion and contraction
there arises necessarily a common element,
but one which exists only <i>in change</i>. If
it is to exist <i>outside</i> of change, then the
<i>change itself</i> must become fixed. The <i>active</i>
in change is the productivity sundered
within itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>c</i>) It is asked:</p>

<p class='c006'>(α) By what means such change can be
fixed at all; it cannot be fixed by anything
that is contained as a link in change itself,
and must therefore be fixed by a <i>tertium
quid</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(β) But this <i>tertium quid</i> must be able
to <i>invade</i> that original antithesis; but <i>outside</i>
of that antithesis nothing <i>is</i><a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a>; it (that
<i>tertium quid</i>) must therefore be primarily
contained in it, as something which is
mediated by the antithesis, and by which
in turn the antithesis is mediated; for
otherwise there is no ground why it should
be primarily contained in that antithesis.</p>

<p class='c006'>The antithesis is dissolution of identity.
But nature is <i>primarily</i> identity. <i>In</i> that
antithesis, therefore, there must again be
a struggle after identity. This struggle is
immediately conditioned <i>through</i> the antithesis;
for if there was no antithesis,
there would be identity, absolute rest, and
therefore no <i>struggle</i> toward identity. If,
on the other hand, there were not identity
in the antithesis, the antithesis itself
could not endure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Identity produced out of difference is
indifference; that <i>tertium quid</i> is therefore
a <i>struggle towards indifference</i>—a
struggle which is conditioned, by the difference
itself, and by which it, on the
other hand, is conditioned.—(The difference
must not be looked upon as a difference
at all, and is nothing for the intuition,
except through a third, which sustains it—to
which change itself adheres.)</p>

<p class='c006'>This <i>tertium quid</i>, therefore, is all that
is substrate in that primal change. But
substrate posits change as much as change
posits substrate; and there is here no
first and no second; but difference and
struggle towards indifference, are, as far
time is concerned, one and contemporary.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Axiom.</i> No identity in Nature is absolute,
but all is only indifference.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since that <i>tertium quid</i> itself <i>presupposes</i>
the primary antithesis, the antithesis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>itself cannot be <i>absolutely</i> removed by it;
<i>the condition of the continuance of that
tertium quid</i> [of that third activity, or of
Nature] <i>is the perpetual continuance of the
antithesis</i>, just as, conversely, <i>the continuance
of the antithesis is conditioned by the
continuance of the tertium quid</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>But how, then, shall the antithesis be
thought as continuing?</p>

<p class='c006'>We have one primary antithesis, between
the limits of which all Nature must lie; if
we assume that the factors of this antithesis
can really pass over into each other,
or go together absolutely in some <i>tertium
quid</i> (some individual product), then the
antithesis is removed, and along with it
the <i>struggle</i>, and so all the activity of
nature. But that the antithesis should endure,
is thinkable only by its being <i>infinite</i>—by
the extreme limits being held
asunder <i>in infinitum</i>—<i>so that always only
the mediating links of the synthesis, never
the last and absolute synthesis itself, can be
produced</i>, in which case it is only <i>relative
points of indifference</i> that are always attained,
never absolute ones, and every
successively originated difference leaves
behind a new and still unremoved antithesis,
and this again goes over into indifference,
which, in its turn, <i>partially</i>
removes the primary antithesis. Through
the original antithesis and the struggle towards
indifference, there arises a product,
but the product partially does away with
the antithesis; through the doing away of
that part—that is, through the origination
of the product itself—there arises a new
antithesis, different from the one that has
been done away with, and through it, a product
different from the first; but even this
leaves the absolute antithesis unremoved,
duality therefore, and through it a product,
will arise anew, and so on to infinity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us say, for example, that by the
product <i>A</i>, the antitheses <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> are
united, the antitheses <i>b</i> and <i>e</i> still lie
outside of that union. This latter is
done away with in <i>B</i>, but this product
also leaves the antithesis <i>a</i> and <i>f</i> unremoved;
if we say that <i>a</i> and <i>f</i> mark the
extreme limits, then the union of these
will be that product which can never be
arrived at.</p>

<p class='c006'>Between the extremes <i>a</i> and <i>f</i>, lie the
antitheses <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>e</i>; but the series
of these intermediate antitheses is infinite;
all these intermediate antitheses are included
in the one absolute antithesis.—In the
product <i>A</i>, of <i>a</i> only <i>c</i>, and of <i>f</i> only <i>d</i> is
removed; let what remains of <i>a</i> be called
<i>b</i>, and of <i>f</i>, <i>e</i>; these will indeed, by virtue
of the absolute struggle towards indifference,
become again united, but they leave
a new antithesis uncancelled, and so there
remains between <i>a</i> and <i>f</i> an infinite series
of intermediate antitheses, and the product
in which those absolutely cancel themselves
never <i>is</i>, but only <i>becomes</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This infinitely progressive formation
must be thus represented. The original
antithesis would necessarily be cancelled
in the primal product <i>A</i>. The product
would necessarily fall at the indifference-point
of <i>a</i> and <i>f</i>, but inasmuch as the antithesis
is an absolute one, which can be
cancelled only in an infinitely continued,
never actual, synthesis, <i>A</i> must be thought
as the centre of an infinite periphery,
(whose diameter is the infinite line <i>a f</i>.)
Since in the product of <i>a</i> and <i>f</i>, only <i>c</i> and
<i>d</i> are united, there arises in it the new division
<i>b</i> and <i>e</i>, the product will therefore
divide up into opposite directions; at the
point where the struggle towards indifference
attains the preponderance, <i>b</i> and <i>e</i>
will combine and form a new product different
from the first—but between <i>a</i> and <i>f</i>,
there still lie an infinite number of antitheses;
the indifference-point <i>B</i> is therefore
the centre of a periphery which is
comprehended in the first, but is itself
again infinite, and so on.</p>

<p class='c006'>The antithesis of <i>b</i> and <i>e</i> in <i>B</i> is <i>maintained</i>
through <i>A</i>, because it (<i>A</i>) leaves
the antithesis <i>un-united</i>; in like manner
the antithesis in <i>C</i> is <i>maintained</i> through
<i>B</i>, because <i>B</i>, in its turn, cancels only a
part of <i>a</i> and <i>f</i>. But the antithesis in <i>C</i> is
maintained through <i>B</i>, only in so far as <i>A</i>
maintains the antithesis in <i>B</i>.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a> What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>therefore in <i>C</i> and <i>B</i> results <i>from</i> this antithesis—[suppose,
for example, the result
of it were universal gravitation]—is <i>occasioned</i>
by the common influence of <i>A</i>, so
that <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, and the infinite number of
other products that come, as intermediate
links between <i>a</i> and <i>f</i>, are, in relation to
<i>A</i>, only <i>one</i> product.—The <i>difference</i>, which
remains over in <i>A</i> after the union of <i>c</i> and
<i>d</i>, is only <i>one</i>, into which then <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, &amp;c.,
again divide.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the continuance of the antithesis is,
in the case of every product, the condition
of the struggle towards indifference, and
thus a struggle towards indifference is
maintained through <i>A</i> in <i>B</i>, and through
<i>B</i> in <i>C</i>.—But the antithesis which <i>A</i> leaves
uncancelled, is only one, and therefore
also this tendency in <i>B</i>, in <i>C</i>, and so on to
infinity, is only conditioned and maintained
through <i>A</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The organization thus determined is no
other than the organization of the Universe
in the system of gravitation.—<i>Gravity</i> is
<i>simple</i>, but its <i>condition</i> is duplicity.—Indifference
arises only out of difference.—The
cancelled duality is matter, inasmuch
as it is only mass.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>absolute</i> indifference-point exists
nowhere, but is, as it were, divided among
several <i>single</i> points.—The Universe which
forms itself from the centre towards the
periphery, <i>seeks</i> the point at which even the
extreme antitheses of nature cancel themselves;
the impossibility of this cancelling
guarantees the infinity of the Universe.</p>

<p class='c006'>From every product <i>A</i>, the uncancelled
antithesis is carried over to a new one, <i>B</i>,
the former thereby becoming the cause of
duality and gravitation for <i>B</i>.—(This carrying
over is what is called action by distribution,
the theory of which receives
light only at this point.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a>)—Thus, for example,
the sun, being only <i>relative</i> indifference,
maintains, as far as its sphere of
action reaches, the antithesis, which is the
condition of weight upon the subordinate
world-bodies.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The indifference is cancelled at every
step, and at every step it is restored.
Hence, weight acts upon a body at rest as
well as upon one in motion.—The universal
restoration of duality, and its recancelling
at every step, can [that is] appear
only as a <i>nisus</i> against a third (somewhat).
This third (somewhat) is therefore the pure
zero—abstracted from tendency it is nothing
[= 0], therefore purely ideal, (marking
only direction)—a <i>point</i>.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Gravity [the
centre of gravity] is in the case of every
total product only <i>one</i> [for the antithesis
is one], and so also the relative indifference-point
is only <i>one</i>. The indifference-point
of the <i>individual</i> body marks only the line
of direction of its tendency towards the
universal indifference-point; hence this
point may be regarded as the only one at
which gravity acts; just as that, whereby
bodies alone attain consistence for us, is
simply this tendency outwards.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Vertical falling towards this point is not
a simple, but a compound motion, and it is
a subject for wonder that this has not been
perceived before.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Gravity is not proportional to mass (for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>what is this mass but an abstraction of the
specific gravity which you have hypostatized?);
but, conversely, the mass of a body
is only the expression of the momentum,
with which the antithesis in it cancels itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>d</i>) By the foregoing, the construction
of matter in general is completed, but not
the construction of specific difference in
matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which all the matter of <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, &amp;c.,
in relation to <i>A</i> has <i>common</i> under it, is
the difference which is not cancelled by <i>A</i>,
and which again cancels itself <i>in part</i> in
<i>B</i> and <i>C</i>—hence, therefore, the gravity mediated
by that difference.</p>

<p class='c006'>What <i>distinguishes B</i> and <i>C</i> from <i>A</i> therefore,
is the difference which is not cancelled
by <i>A</i>, and which becomes the condition of
gravity in the case of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>.—Similarly,
what distinguishes <i>C</i> from <i>B</i> (if <i>C</i> is a
product subordinate to <i>B</i>), is the difference
which is not cancelled by <i>B</i>, and which is
again carried over to <i>C</i>. Gravity, therefore,
is not the same thing for the higher
and for the subaltern world-bodies, and
there is as much variety in the central
forces as in the conditions of attraction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The means whereby, in the products <i>A</i>,
<i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, which, in so far as they are opposed
to <i>each other</i>, represent products absolutely
<i>homogeneous</i> [because the antithesis is
the same for the <i>whole product</i>,] another
difference of individual products is possible,
is the possibility of a difference of relation
between the factors in the cancelling, so
that, for example, in <i>X</i>, the positive factor,
and in <i>Y</i>, the negative factor, has the preponderance,
(thus rendering the one body
positively, and the other negatively, electric).—All
difference is difference of electricity.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>e</i>) That the identity of matter is not
<i>absolute</i> identity, but only <i>indifference</i>, can
be proved from the possibility of again
cancelling the identity, and from the accompanying
phenomena.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a> We may be allowed,
for brevity’s sake, to include this
recancelling, and its resultant phenomena
under the expression <i>dynamical process</i>,
without, of course, affirming decisively
whether anything of the sort is everywhere
actual.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Now there will be exactly as many stages
in the dynamical process as there are stages
of transition from difference to indifference.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>(α) The first stage will be marked by
objects <i>in which the reproduction and recancelling
of the antithesis at every step is
still itself an object of perception</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The whole product is reproduced anew
at every step,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a> that is, the antithesis which
cancels itself in it, springs up afresh every
moment; but this reproduction of difference
loses itself immediately in <i>universal</i>
gravity;<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a> this reproduction, therefore, can
be perceived only in <i>individual</i> objects,
which seem to gravitate <i>towards each other</i>;
since, if to the one factor of an antithesis
is offered its opposite (in another) <i>both
factors</i> become <i>heavy with reference to each
other</i>, in which case, therefore, the general
gravity is not cancelled, but a special one
occurs <i>within</i> the general.—An instance of
such a mutual relation between two products,
is that of the earth and the magnetic
needle, in which is distinguished the continual
recancelling of indifference in gravitation
towards the poles<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a>—the continual
sinking back into identity<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a> in gravitation
towards the universal indifference-point.
Here, therefore, it is not the <i>object</i>, but the
<i>being-reproduced of the object</i> that becomes
object.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>(β) At the first stage, <i>in</i> the identity of
the product, its duplicity again appears;
at the second, the antithesis will divide up
and distribute itself among different objects
(<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>). From the fact that the
one factor of the antithesis attained a <i>relative</i>
preponderance in <i>A</i>, the other in <i>B</i>,
there will arise, according to the same law
as in α, a <i>gravitation</i> of the factors toward
each other, and so a new difference, which,
when the relative equiponderance is restored
in each, results in repulsion<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a>—(change
of attraction and repulsion, <i>second</i>
stage in which matter is seen)—<i>electricity</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(γ) At the second stage the one factor of
the product had only a <i>relative</i> preponderance;<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a>
at the <i>third</i> it will attain an <i>absolute</i>
one—by the two bodies <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, the
original antithesis is again completely represented—matter
will revert to the <i>first
stage</i> of becoming.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the <i>first stage</i> there is still <span class='fss'>PURE</span> <i>difference</i>,
without substrate [for it was only
out of it that a substrate arose]; at the
second stage it is the <i>simple</i> factors of two
<i>products</i> that are opposed to each other; at
the third it is the <span class='fss'>PRODUCTS THEMSELVES</span> that
are opposed; here is difference in the <i>third</i>
power.</p>

<p class='c006'>If two products are absolutely opposed
to each other,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a> then in each of them singly
indifference of gravity (by which alone
each <i>is</i>) must be <i>cancelled</i>, and they must
gravitate to <i>each other</i>.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a> (In the second
stage there was only a mutual gravitating
of the factors to each other—here there is
a gravitating of the products.)<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a>—This process,
therefore, first assails the <i>indifferent
(element) of the</i> <span class='fss'>PRODUCT</span>—that is, the products
themselves dissolve.</p>

<p class='c006'>Where there is equal difference there is
equal indifference; difference of <i>products</i>,
therefore, can end only with <i>indifference
of products</i>.—(All hitherto deduced indifference
has been only indifference of substrateless,
or at least simple factors.—Now
we come to speak of an indifference of products.)
This struggle will not cease till
there exists a common product. The product,
in forming itself, passes, from both
sides, through all the intermediate links
that lie between the two products [for example,
through all the intermediate stages
of specific gravity], till it finds the point
at which it succumbs to indifference, and
the product is fixed.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>GENERAL REMARK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>By virtue of the first construction, the
product is posited as identity; this identity,
it is true, again resolves itself into an
antithesis, which, however, is no longer an
antithesis cleaving to <i>products</i>, but an antithesis
in the <i>productivity</i> itself.—The
product, therefore, <i>as</i> product, is identity.—But
even in the sphere of products,
there again arises a duplicity in the second
stage, and it is only in the third that even
the duplicity of the <i>products</i> again becomes
<i>identity</i> of the products.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a>—There is therefore
here also a progress from thesis to antithesis,
and thence to synthesis.—The last
synthesis of matter closes in the chemical
process; if composition is to proceed
yet further in it, then this circle must open
again.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>We must leave it to our readers themselves
to make out the conclusions to which
the principles here stated lead, and the
universal interdependence which is introduced
by them into the phenomena of Nature.—Nevertheless,
to give one instance:
when in the chemical process the bond of
gravity is loosed, the phenomenon of <i>light</i>
which accompanies the chemical process in
its greatest perfection (in the process of
combustion), is a remarkable phenomenon,
which, when followed out further, confirms
what is stated in the Outlines, page 146:—“The
action of light must stand in secret
interdependence with the action of gravity
which the central bodies exercise.”—For,
is not the indifference dissolved at every
step, since gravity, as ever active, presupposes
a continual cancelling of indifference?—It
is thus, therefore, that the sun,
by the distribution exercised on the earth,
causes a universal separation of matter
into the primary antithesis (and hence
gravity). This universal cancelling of indifference
is what appears to us (who are
endowed with life) as <i>light</i>; wherever,
therefore, that indifference is dissolved (in
the chemical process), there light <i>must</i> appear
to us. According to the foregoing, it is
<i>one</i> antithesis which, beginning at magnetism,
and proceeding through electricity, at
last loses itself in the chemical phenomena.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
In the chemical process, namely, <i>the
whole product</i> + <i>E</i> or - <i>E</i> (the <i>positively</i>
electric body, in the case of absolutely <i>unburnt</i>
bodies, is always the <i>more combustible</i>;<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
whereas the <i>absolutely incombustible</i>
is the cause of all <i>negatively</i> electric
condition;) and if we may be allowed to
invert the case, what then are bodies themselves
but condensed (confined) electricity?
In the chemical process the whole body
dissolves into + <i>E</i> or - <i>E</i>. Light is everywhere
the appearing of the <i>positive</i> factor
in the primary antithesis; hence, wherever
the antithesis is restored, there is <i>light</i> for
us, because generally only the positive factor
is beheld, and the negative one is only
felt.—Is the connection of the diurnal and
annual deviations of the magnetic needle
with light now conceivable—and, if in
every chemical process the antithesis is
dissolved, is it conceivable that Light is
the cause and beginning of all chemical
process?<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>(<i>f</i>) The dynamical process is nothing
but the second construction of matter, and
however many stages there are in the dynamical
process, there are the same number
in the original construction of matter.
This axiom is the converse of axiom <i>e</i>.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
That which, in the dynamical process is
perceived in the product, takes place <i>outside</i>
of the product with the simple factors
of all duality.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first start to original production is
the limitation of productivity through the
primitive antithesis, which, <i>as</i> antithesis
(and as the condition of all construction),
is distinguished only in <i>magnetism</i>; the
second stage of production is the <i>change</i>
of contraction and expansion, and as such
becomes visible only in <i>electricity</i>; finally,
the third stage is the transition of this
change into indifference—a change which
is recognized as such only in <i>chemical</i> phenomena.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Magnetism, Electricity and Chemical
Process</span> are the <i>categories</i> of the original
construction of nature [matter]—the latter
escapes us and lies outside of intuition,
the former are what of it remains behind,
what stands firm, what is fixed—the general
schemes for the construction of matter.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>And—in order to close the circle at
the point where it began—just as in
organic nature, in the scale of sensibility,
irritability, and formative instinct,
the secret of the production of the <i>whole
of organic nature</i> lies in each individual,
so in the scale of magnetism, electricity,
and chemical process, so far as it (the
scale) can be distinguished in the individual
body, is to be found the secret of the
production of <i>Nature from itself</i> [of the
whole of Nature<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a>].</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>C.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>We have now approached nearer the
solution of our problem, which was: To
reduce the construction of organic and inorganic
nature to a common expression.</p>

<p class='c006'>Inorganic nature is the product of the
<i>first</i> power, organic nature of the <i>second</i><a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a>—(this
was demonstrated above; it will
soon appear that the latter is the product
of a still higher power)—hence the latter,
in view of the former, appears contingent;
the former, in view of the latter, necessary.
Inorganic nature can take its origin
from <i>simple</i> factors, organic nature only
from products, which again become factors.
Hence an inorganic nature generally
will appear as having been from all eternity,
the organic nature as <i>originated</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the organic nature, indifference can
never be arrived at in the same way in
which it is arrived at in inorganic nature,
because life consists in nothing more than
a continual <i>prevention of the attainment of
indifference</i> [a prevention of the absolute
transition of productivity into product]
whereby manifestly there comes about
only a condition which is, so to speak,
extorted from Nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>By organization, matter—which has already
been composed for the second time
by the chemical process—is once more
thrown back to the initial point of formation
(the circle above described is again
opened); it is no wonder that matter always
thrown back again into formation at
last returns as a perfect product.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same stages, through which the
production of Nature originally passes,
are also passed through by the production
of the organic product; only that the latter,
even <i>in the first stage</i>, at least begins
with products of the <i>simple</i> power.—Organic
production also begins with limitation,
not of the <i>primary</i> productivity, but of
the <i>productivity of a product</i>; organic
formation also takes place through the
change of expansion and contraction, just
as primary formation does; but in this
case it is a change taking place, not in
the simple productivity, but in the compound.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there is all this, too, in the chemical
process,<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a> and yet in the chemical process
indifference is attained. The vital process,
therefore, must again be a higher power of
the chemical; and if the scheme that lies
at the base of the latter is duplicity, the
scheme of the former will of necessity be
<i>triplicity</i> [the former will be a process of
the third power]. But the scheme of triplicity
is [in reality] that [the fundamental
scheme] of the galvanic process (Ritter’s
<i>Demonstration</i>, &amp;c., p. 172); therefore
the galvanic process (or the process of irritation)
stands a power higher than the
chemical, and the third element, which
the latter lacks and the former has, prevents
indifference from being arrived at in
the organic product.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As irritation does not allow indifference
to be arrived at in the individual product,
and as the antithesis is still there (for the
primary antithesis still pursues us),<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a> there
remains for nature no alternative but separation
of the factors in <i>different</i> products.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
The formation of the individual product,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>for that very reason, cannot be a completed
formation, and the product can never
cease to be productive.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a> The contradiction
in Nature is this, that the product
must be <i>productive</i> [i. e. a product of the
third power], and that, notwithstanding,
the product, <i>as</i> a product of the third
power, must pass over into indifference.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This contradiction Nature tries to solve
by mediating <i>indifference</i> itself through
<i>productivity</i>, but even this does not succeed—for
the act of productivity is only
the kindling spark of a new process of irritation;
the product of productivity is a
<i>new productivity</i>. Into this as its product
the productivity of the <i>individual</i> now indeed
passes over; the individual, therefore,
ceases more rapidly or slowly to be
productive, and Nature reaches the indifference-point
with it only after the latter
has got down to a product of the second
power.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>And now the result of all this?—The
condition of the inorganic (as well as of
the organic) product, is duality. In any
case, however, organic <i>productive product</i>
is so only from the fact <i>that the difference</i>
<span class='fss'>NEVER</span> <i>becomes indifference</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is [in so far] therefore impossible to
reduce the construction of organic and of
inorganic product to a <i>common</i> expression,
and the problem is incorrect, and therefore
the solution impossible. The problem
presupposes that organic product and
inorganic product are mutually <i>opposed</i>,
whereas the latter is only the <i>higher
power</i> of the former, and is produced
only by the higher power of the forces
through which the latter also is produced.
Sensibility is only the higher power of
magnetism; irritability only the higher
power of electricity; formative instinct
only the higher power of the chemical process.—But
sensibility, and irritability, and
formative instinct are all only included in
that <i>one</i> process of irritation. (Galvanism
affects them all).<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a> But if they are only
the higher functions of magnetism, electricity,
&amp;c., there must again be a higher
synthesis for these in Nature<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a>—and this,
however, it is certain, can be sought for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>only in Nature, in so far as, viewed as a
whole, it is <i>absolutely</i> organic.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this, moreover, is also the result to
which the genuine Science of Nature must
lead, viz: that the difference between organic
and inorganic nature is only in Nature
as object, and that Nature as originally-<i>productive</i>
soars above both.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c006'>There remains only one remark, which
we may make, not so much on account of
its intrinsic interest, as in order to justify
what we said above in regard to the relation
of our system to the hitherto so-called
dynamical system. If it were asked, for
instance, in what form our original antithesis,
cancelled, or rather fixed, in the product,
would appear from the stand-point
of reflection, we cannot better designate
what is found in the product by analysis,
than as <i>expansive</i> and <i>attractive</i> (retarding)
<i>force</i>, to which then however, gravitation
must always be added as the <i>tertium quid</i>,
whereby those opposites become what they
are.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, the designation is valid
only for the stand-point of reflection or of
<i>analysis</i>, and cannot be applied for <i>synthesis</i>
at all; and thus our system leaves off
exactly at the point where the Dynamical
Physics of Kant and his successors begins,
namely, at the antithesis as it presents
itself in the product.</p>

<p class='c006'>And with this the author delivers over
these Elements of a System of Speculative
Physics to the thinking heads of the age,
begging them to make common cause with
him in this science, which opens up views
of no mean order, and to make up by their
own powers, acquirements and external
relations, for what, in these respects, he
lacks.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>ANALYSIS OF HEGEL’S ÆSTHETICS. <br /> [Translated from the French of <span class='sc'>M. Ch. Benard</span>, by <span class='sc'>J. A. Martling</span>.]</h3>
<p class='c005'>II. <span class='sc'>Sculpture.</span>—Architecture fashions
and disposes of the masses of inert nature
according to geometric laws, and it
thus succeeds in presenting only a vague
and incomplete symbol of the thought.
Its [thought’s] progress consists in detaching
itself from physical existence, and in
expressing spirit in a manner more in conformity
with its nature. The first step which
art takes in this career does not yet indicate
the return of spirit upon itself, which
would render necessary a wholly spiritual
mode of expression, and signs as immaterial
as thought; but spirit appears under
a corporeal, organized living form. What
art represents is the animate, living body,
and above all the human body, with which
the soul is completely identified. Such
is the <i>rôle</i> and the place which belong to
Sculpture.</p>

<p class='c006'>It still resembles <i>architecture</i> in this,
that it fashions extended and solid material;
but it is distinguished from it in
this, that this material, in its hands, ceases
to be foreign to spirit. The corporeal
form blends with it, and becomes its living
image. Compared to poetry, it seems
at first to have the advantage over it of
representing objects under their natural
and visible form, while speech expresses
ideas only by sounds; but this
plastic clearness is more than compensated
by the superiority of language as a means
of expression. Speech reveals the innermost
thoughts with a clearness altogether
different from the lines of the figure, the
countenance, and the attitudes of the
body; further, it shows man in action—active
in virtue of his ideas and his passions;
it retraces the various phases of a
complete event. Sculpture represents
neither the inmost sentiments of the soul,
nor its definite passions. It presents the
individual character only in general, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>to such an extent as the body can express
in a given moment, without movement,
without living action, without development.
It yields also, in this respect, to
painting, which, by the employment of
color and the effects of light, acquires
more of naturalness and truth, and, above
all, a great superiority of expression.
Thus, one might think at first that Sculpture
would do well to add to its own
proper means those of painting. This is
a grave error; for that abstract form, deprived
of color, which the statuary employs
is not an imperfection in it—it is
the limit which this art places upon itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each art represents a degree, a particular
form of the beautiful, a moment of the
development of spirit, and expresses it
excellently. To Sculpture it belongs to
represent the perfection of the bodily
form, plastic beauty, life, soul, spirit animating
a body. If it should desire to
transcend this limit, it would fail entirely;
the use of foreign means would alter the
purity of its works.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is with art here as with science; each
science has its object, peculiar, limited,
abstract; its circle, in which it moves, and
where it is free. Geometry studies extension,
and extension only; arithmetic,
number; jurisprudence, the right; &amp;c. Allow
any one to encroach upon the others,
and to aim at universality; you introduce
into its domain confusion, obscurity, real
imperfection. They develop differently
different objects; clearness, perfection,
and even liberty, are to be purchased only
at this price.</p>

<p class='c006'>Art, too, has many phases; to each a
distinct art corresponds. Sculpture stops
at form, which it fashions according to its
peculiar laws; to add color thereto is to
alter, to disfigure its object. Thereby it
preserves its character, its functions, its
independence; it represents the material,
corporeal side, of which architecture
gives only a vague and imperfect
symbol. It is given to painting,
to substitute for this real form, a simple
visible appearance, which then admits
color, by joining to it the effects of perspective,
of light and shade. But Sculpture
ought to respect its proper limits, to
confine itself to representing the corporeal
form as an expression of the individual
spirit, of the soul, divested of passion
and definite sentiment. In so doing, it
can so much the better content itself with
the human form in itself, in which the
soul is, as it were, spread over all points.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is also the reason why Sculpture
does not represent spirit in action, in a
succession of movements, having a determined
end, nor engaged in those enterprises
and actions which manifest a character.
It prefers to present it in a calm
attitude, or when the movement and the
grouping indicate only the commencement
of action. Through this very thing, that
it presents to our eyes spirit absorbed
in the corporeal form, designed to manifest
it in its entirety, there is lacking the
essential point where the expression of
the soul centres itself, the glance of the
eye. Neither has it any need of the
magic of colors, which, by the fineness
and variety of their shadings, are fitted
to express all the richness of particular
traits of character, and to manifest the
soul, with all the emotions which agitate
it. Sculpture ought not to admit materials
of which it has no need at the step
where it stops. The image fashioned by
it, is of a single color; it employs primitive
matter, the most simple, uniform,
unicolored: marble, ivory, gold, brass,
the metals. It is this which the Greeks
had the ability perfectly to seize and hold.</p>

<p class='c006'>After these considerations upon the
general character of Sculpture, and its
connections with other arts, Hegel approaches
the more special study and the
theory of this art. He considers it—1st,
in its principle; 2d, in its ideal; 3d,
in the materials which it employs, as well
as in its various modes of representation
and the principal epochs of its historic
development.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are compelled to discard a crowd of
interesting details upon each of these
points, and to limit ourselves to general
ideas.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. To seize fully the principle of Sculpture
and the essence of this art, it is necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to examine, in the first place, what
constitutes the <i>content</i> of its representations,
then the corporeal <i>form</i> which
should express it; last, to see how, from
the perfect accord of the idea and the
form, results the <i>ideal</i> of Sculpture as it
has been realized in Greek art.</p>

<p class='c006'>The essential content of the representations
of Sculpture is, as has been said,
spirit incarnate in a corporeal form. Now,
not every situation of the soul is fitted to
be thus manifested. Action, movement,
determined passion, can not be represented
under a material form; that ought to show
to us the soul diffused through the entire
body, through all its members. Thus,
what Sculpture represents is the individual
spirit, or, according to the formula of the
author, the spiritual individuality in its
essence, with its general, universal, eternal
character; spirit elevated above the
inclinations, the caprices, the transient
impressions which flow in upon the soul,
without profoundly penetrating it. This
entire phase of the personal principle
ought to be excluded from the representations
of Sculpture. The content of its
works is the essence, the substantial, true,
invariable part of character, in opposition
to what is accidental and transient.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, this state of spirit, not yet particularized,
unalterable, self-centered, calm,
is the divine in opposition to finite existence,
which is developed in the midst of
accidents and contingencies, the exhibition
of which this world of change and diversity
presents us.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to this, Sculpture should represent
the divine in itself, in its infinite
calm, and its eternal, immovable sublimity,
without the discord of action and situation.
If, afterward, affecting a more determinate
mode, it represents something human in
form and character, it ought still to thrust
back all which is accidental and transient;
to admit only the fixed, invariable side,
the ground of character. This fixed element
is what Sculpture should express as
alone constituting the true individuality;
it represents its personages as beings complete
and perfect in themselves, in an absolute
repose freed from all foreign influence.
The eternal in gods and men is
what it is called upon to offer to our contemplation
in perfect and unalterable clearness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the idea which constitutes the
essential content of the works of Sculpture.
What is the <i>form</i> under which this idea
should appear? We have seen, it is the
body, the corporeal form. But the only
form worthy to represent the spirit, is the
<i>human form</i>. This form, in its turn, ought
to be represented, not in that wherein it
approximates the animal form, but in its
ideal beauty; that is to say, free, harmonious,
reflecting the spirit in the features
which characterize it, in all its proportions,
its purity, the regularity of its lines, by
its mien, its postures, etc. It should express
spirit in its calmness, its serenity—both
soul and life, but above all, spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>These principles serve to determine the
ideal of beauty under the physical form.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must take care, in the works of Sculpture,
not to confound this manner of looking
at the perfect correspondence of the
soul and bodily forms, with the study of
the lineaments of the countenance, etc.
The science of Gall, or of Lavater, which
studies the correspondence of characters
with certain lineaments of face or forms of
head, has nothing in common with the artistic
studies of the works of the statuary.
These seem, it is true, to invite us to this
study; but its point of view is wholly different;
it is that of the harmonious and
necessary accord of forms, from which
beauty results. The ground of Sculpture
excludes, moreover, precisely all the peculiarities
of individual character to which
the physiognomist attaches himself. The
ideal form manifests only the fixed, regular,
invariable, although living and individual
type. It is then forbidden to the
artist, as far as regards the physiognomy,
to represent the most expressive and determinate
lineaments of the countenance;
for, beside looks, properly so-called, the
expression of the physiognomy includes
many things which are reflected transiently
upon the face, in the countenance or the
carriage, the smile and the glance. Sculpture
should interdict to itself things so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>transient, and confine itself to the permanent
traits of the expression of the spirit;
in a word, it should incarnate in the human
form the spiritual principle in its nature,
at once general and individual, but
not yet particularized. To maintain these
two terms in just harmony, is the problem
which falls to statuary, and which the
Greeks have resolved.</p>

<p class='c006'>The consequences to be deduced from
these principles are the following:</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, Sculpture is, more than
the other arts, suited to the ideal, and this
because of the perfect adaptation of the
form to the idea; in the second place, it
constitutes the centre of classic art, which
represents this perfect accord of the idea
and the sensuous form. It alone, in fact,
offers to us those ideal figures, pure from
all admixture—the perfect expression of
physical beauty. It realizes, before our
eyes, the union of the human and divine,
under the corporeal form. The sense of
plastic beauty was given above all to the
Greeks, and this trait appears everywhere,
not only in Greek art and Greek mythology,
but in the real world, in historic personages:
Pericles, Phidias, Socrates, Plato,
Xenophon, Sophocles, Thucydides, those
artistic natures, artists of themselves—characters
grand and free, supported upon
the basis of a strong individuality, worthy
of being placed beside the immortal gods
which Greek Sculpture represents.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. After having determined the principle
of Sculpture, Hegel applies it to the study
of the <i>beau ideal</i>, as the master-pieces of
Greek art have realized it. He examines
successively and in detail the character
and conditions of the <i>ideal form</i> in the different
parts of the human body, <i>the face</i>,
<i>the looks</i>, <i>the bearing</i>, <i>the dress</i>. Upon all
these points he faithfully follows Winckelmann,
recapitulates him, and constantly
cites him. The philosopher meanwhile preserves
his originality; it consists in the
manner in which he systematizes that
which is simply described in the History
of Art, and in giving throughout, the reason
of that which the great critic, with his
exquisite and profound sense, has so admirably
seized and undeniably proved, but
without being able to unfold the theory of
it. The subject gathers, henceforth, new
interest from this explication. We may
cite, in particular, the description of the
Greek profile, which, in the hands of the
philosopher, takes the character of a geometric
theorem. It is at the same time an
example which demonstrates unanswerably
the absolute character of physical beauty.
The beauty of these lines has nothing arbitrary;
they indicate the superiority of
spirit, and the pre-eminence of the forms
which express it above those which are
suited to the functions of the animal nature.
What he afterwards says of the
looks, of the bearing, of the postures, of
the antique dress compared with the modern
dress, and of its ideal character, presents
no less interest. But all these details,
where the author shows much of discrimination,
of genius even, and spirit, escape in
the analysis. The article where he describes
the particular attributes and the
accessories which distinguish the personages
of Greek Sculpture, although in great
part borrowed also from Winckelmann,
shows a spirit familiarized with the knowledge
of the works of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The chapter devoted to the different
<i>modes</i> of representation of the materials
of Sculpture, and of its historic development,
is equally full of just and delicate
observations. All this is not alone from a
theorist, but from a connoisseur and an
enlightened judge. The appreciation of
the <i>materials of Sculpture</i>, and the comparison
of their æsthetic value, furnish
also to the author some very ingenious remarks
upon a subject which seems scarcely
susceptible of interest. Finally, in a rapid
sketch, Hegel retraces the <i>historic development</i>
of Sculpture, Egyptian Statuary,
Etruscan art, the school of Ægina, are
characterized in strokes remarkable for
precision.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arrived at <i>Christian Sculpture</i>, without
disputing the richness and the ability
which it has displayed in its works in wood,
in stone, etc., and its excellence in respect
to expression, Hegel maintains with reason,
that the Christian principle is little favorable
to Sculpture; and that in wishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>to express the Christian sentiment in its
profundity and its vivacity, it passes its
proper limits. “The self-inspection of the
soul, the moral suffering, the torments of
body and of spirit, martyrdom and penitence,
death and resurrection, the mystic
depth, the love and out-gushing of the
heart, are wholly unsuited to be represented
by Sculpture, which requires calmness,
serenity of spirit, and in expression,
harmony of forms.” Thus, Sculpture here
remains rather an ornament of architecture;
it sculptures saints, bas reliefs upon
the niches and porches of churches, turrets,
etc. From another side, through arabesques
and bas reliefs, it approximates
the principle of painting, by giving too
much expression to its figures, or by making
portraits in marble and in stone.
Sculpture comes back to its true principle,
at the epoch of the <i>renaissance</i>, by taking
for models the beautiful forms of Greek
art.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>A DIALOGUE ON MUSIC. <br /> By <span class='sc'>Edward Sobolewski</span>.</h3>
<p class='c005'>Q. Tell me what is good music?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. Concerning tastes—all fine natures—not
the “fair sex” only, possess, as Bossuet
says, an instinct for harmony of forms,
colors, style and tones, especially for the
latter, because the nerves of the ear being
more exposed, are consequently more sensitive.</p>

<p class='c006'>Discords massed together without system,
produce a more disagreeable effect
than ill-assorted colors; and on the other
hand, the etherial beauty of tone-poetry
excites the soul more powerfully than the
splendor of a Titian or Correggio.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. This “instinct” and “taste,” are
they one and the same?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. To a certain degree only—though
many amateurs, critics, musicians, and
even composers, have had no other guide
than a fine instinct.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. You speak as Pistocchi to the celebrated
Farinelli: “A singer needs a hundred
things, but a good voice is ninety-nine of
them—the hundredth is the cultivation of
the voice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A. The instinct of a delicate, sensitive
organization, may go far, but I think the
hundredth thing is also necessary; therefore,
one possessed of the finest voice, but
uncultivated, will sing sometimes badly,
sometimes pretty well, but never quite perfectly
for a real judge.</p>

<p class='c006'>So it is with taste. Depending on natural
gifts alone, without cultivation—you
will be sometimes right—as often wrong.
In short, your taste is good, if you find
pleasure in those works only which are
composed according to the principles of
art; on the contrary, your taste is bad,
false, corrupt, if you find pleasure in music
full of faults and defects.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. Therefore, to be correct in taste, I
must know the principles of the art; I
must know the rules of “Harmony, Rhythm
and Form,” and perhaps much more.
Why, G. Weber has written three large
volumes on “Harmony” alone. No, it is
too difficult and takes too much time.</p>

<p class='c006'>A. Yet it is not so difficult as it seems.
To understand music rightly, nothing is
necessary but the knowledge of two keys—major
and minor; two kinds of time—common
and triple—one simple chord and
two cadences.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. But Rhythm, Form?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. Form is Rhythm, and Rhythm is time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. Let us begin then with the keys, you
speak of two only—major and minor—but
I have heard something of Ambroseanic,
Gregoryanic, Glareanic and Greek keys,
wherein are composed the beautiful and
sublime compositions of Palestrina, Allegri,
Lotti, that are performed annually
during Passion-week in the church of St.
Peter, at Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'>A. Well, if you like to go so far back,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>we will speak about Ambrose, Gregory,
Glareanus, but there are no such things as
“Greek” keys.</p>

<p class='c006'>The knowledge we have of the music of
the Greeks, is too slight and imperfect to
enable us to assert positively anything concerning
it; and as nothing important or
necessary to modern art is involved, we
may be content to let the music of the ancients
rest in the obscurity which surrounds
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the first Christians, who hated everything
which came from the temples of
the heathens, arose our music.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their religious songs were a production
of the new soul which came into them with
Jesus Christ, and are the foundation of
our great edifice of art, as it now exists.
In the year 385, Saint Ambrose introduced
four keys, D, E, F, G; Pope Gregory, in
597, added four others to these, and named
the four of Ambrose, “authentic moods,”
and his four, which began on every fifth of
the first four, “plagalic.” In these eight
keys, without sharps or flats, are composed
the liturgic songs of the Roman church,
called “Gregorian chants.” They are
written in notes of equal value, without
Rhythm or Metre, and are sung in unison
with loud voice. Glareanus added to those
eight keys, two more, A and C, with their
plagal moods. To distinguish more clearly,
some one called the key beginning with
“D,” Doric, “E,” Phrygic, “F,” Lydic,
“G,” Mixolydic, “A,” Æolic, and “B,”
Tonic. These names are all we have borrowed
from Greece.</p>

<p class='c006'>Palestrina, the preserver of our art,
wrote his compositions in these keys, and
for the highest purity of harmony, rhythmical
beauty, sublime simplicity, and deep
religious feeling, his works are still unrivalled.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. Why don’t you compose in the old
keys and in Palestrina’s style?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. They are used sometimes by Handel
in his Oratorios, by Sebastian Bach in his
fugues for organ and piano. Later, Beethoven
has written an Andante in the Lydic
mood in his string-quartette (A minor). I
myself have composed the first chorus of
Vinvela, in the Mixolydic mood, and in Comala,
the song to the moon, in the Doric
mood; but Handel, Bach, Beethoven, and
myself, have written in our own style, and
never imitated Palestrina’s. Men in similar
situations, only, have similar ideas.
All older works of music utter a language
which we yet understand, but cannot speak.
We feel its deep innermost accents, but
we cannot tune the chords of our soul to
that pitch which harmonizes in every respect
with that feeling. Palestrina’s music
sounds like that of another world; it
is all quite simple; mostly common chords,
here and there only a chord of the sixth;
and always an irresistible charm.</p>

<p class='c006'>This riddle is partially explained, if we
observe how Palestrina selected the tones
for the different parts in his choruses. Let
us take the third, c—e; e. g. let the soprano
and the alto sing this third, and you
will have the same harmonic sound that
the piano or organ gives. But let the tenor
sing one of these tones, and soprano or alto
the other, and the effect will be very different,
although the tones are the same. Palestrina
knew not only the particular sound
of every tone in every voice, but also the
effect which such or such combinations
would produce.</p>

<p class='c006'>This mystery is taught neither by a singing
school, nor by a theory of composition,
and few composers of to-day know it.
How great and beautiful is Beethoven’s
solemn mass in D! What an effect would
it make, had Beethoven possessed the same
knowledge of voices that he had of instruments?
Now, unfortunately, one often
overpowers the others, and the enjoyment
of this composition will be always greater
for the eye than the ear.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will now go back to the old keys.
These are taken from the music produced
at that time, as our two keys, major and
minor, are taken from the melodies of later
times.</p>

<p class='c006'>This seems very simple to us, but not to
our great theorists. Gottfried Weber takes
two keys, major c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, and
minor a, b, c, d, e, f, g <i>sharp</i>, the same
rising and falling equally.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hauptmann, the first teacher of harmony
in the Conservatory of Music at Leipsic,
says in his book, The Nature of Harmony
and Metre, page 30—“The key is formed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>when the common chord (c, e, g), after
having gone through the subdominant-chord
(f, a, c), and dominant-chord (g, b,
d), has come in opposition with itself; this
opposition coupled together, becomes <i>unity</i>
and the <i>key</i>.” He finds in our music three
keys, and names them, the major, the minor,
and the minor major.</p>

<p class='c006'>R. Wagner recognizes no key at all; for
him exists a chromatic scale only. He
says: “The scale is the most closely
united, the most intimately related family
among tones.” He does not like to stay
long in one key, and takes the continuous
change of keys for a quality of the music
of the future; therefore, he finds in Beethoven’s
last symphony, in the melody to
Schiller’s poem, a going <i>back</i>, because it
has scarcely any modulation.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will not be so lavish with keys as
Hauptmann, nor so economical as R. Wagner,
neither are we of Weber’s opinion.
We find in C major the old Glareanic key,
called also “Ionic;” in our A minor of this
day, a “<i>mixtum compositum</i>” of several
old keys; it begins as the “Æolic” a, b,
c, d, e, f, takes then its seventh tone, g
<i>sharp</i>, from the Lydic, transposed a third
higher; uses sometimes also the sixth of the
last, accepts lastly the character of the Phrygic,
transposed a fourth higher, and brings
thus the tone b <i>flat</i> into its scale, which has
been already the subject of much discussion,
although that has never succeeded in
throwing this tone out of many melodies
in A minor. We have melodies which are
the pure A minor from the beginning to the
end, wherein we find f <i>sharp</i> and f <i>natural</i>,
g and g <i>sharp</i>, b and b <i>flat</i>, and the last
oftener than f <i>sharp</i>; therefore, we must
build the scale of A minor, and its harmony,
according to those different tones; it will</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>be a, {b,   c, d, e, {f,         {g <i>sharp</i>, a,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>{b <i>flat</i>,     {f <i>sharp</i>, {g <i>natural</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Let us proceed. The two kinds of time
are common and triple. The rhythm of the
first is—__, that of the second—__ __.
The accentuation of subdivisions is governed
by the same law. It makes no difference
whether a piece of music is written
in 2|3 or 2|4, or even 2|8 time; but good composers
of music, writing in 2|4 time, intend the
same to be of lighter rendition than those
composed in 2|2 time, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>Concerning harmony, there is one chord
only—all other harmonies are passing
notes, inversions, prolongations, suspensions
or retardations of chord-tones, or
from sharped and diminished intervals.
Harmony is a connection of different melodies.
Before chords were known, they
descanted, that is, they tried to sing to a
melody, commonly a sacred hymn, called
<i>cantus firmus</i>, different harmonical tones,
and named this part, <i>Descant</i>; Italian,
<i>soprano</i>; French, <i>Le dessus</i>. Later there was
added to the tenor (which performed the
<i>cantus firmus</i>) a higher part, named <i>alto</i>,
and lastly, a lower part was added called
<i>bass</i>. These four parts, though each melodious
and independent in itself, harmonized
closely with each other, all striving
for the same aim.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even to-day we must necessarily call such
music good, wherein every voice acts independently
of all others, and still in harmony
with the same, in order to express the
reigning feeling, and sustain the various
shades in contrast to non-acting and lifeless
trabants, which may be strikingly seen
in many compositions, particularly in four-part
songs for male voices, by Abt, Gumbert,
Kücken, etc., wherein three voices (<i>Brummstimmen</i>)
accompany the fourth with a
growling sound escaping their closed lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two cadences or musical phrases are
the cadence on the tonic and the cadence
on the dominant. The cadence on the
tonic, consisting of the chord in the dominant,
followed by that of the tonic, concludes
the sense of the musical phrase, and
is called “perfect” when the tonic is in the
highest and lowest part. It corresponds to
a period in language. The cadence on the
dominant consists of the tonic, or the chord
of the second or fourth going to the dominant.
The cadence of the dominant suspends
the sense of the musical phrase without
concluding it. This is likewise the
case with the cadence on the tonic, if the
tonic is not in the highest and lowest part.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. You say nothing of the great mistake
wherein two fifths or octaves follow each
other?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>A. Of course, the true nature of the
proper arrangement of parts excludes all
direct fifths.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is considered by the new school “an exploded
idea.” Mozart himself made use of
fifths in the first finale of Don Giovanni.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. I have heard something of these fifths,
but was told it was “irony,” being contained
in the minuet which Mozart composed
for “country musicians”?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. You also find octaves in S. Bach’s
“Matthew Passion,” p. 25, “On the cross,”
where surely no ironical meaning was intended.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. Do you not say anything in regard
to form?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. Form is an “exploded idea” also.
The composers of the new school construct
their vocal music so as to let the poem govern
the music in relation to metre and
form; in their instrumental compositions,
the form is governed by phantasy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. But what do you understand by a
symphony, sonata or overture?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. I must again go back, in order to explain
this properly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Revolutions often beat the path for new
ideas. Palestrina towers great and unattainable
in his compositions of sacred music,
which breathe and express the purest
catholicism.</p>

<p class='c006'>But a Luther, Zwingli, and others came,
followed soon by Handel and Bach, who,
about the middle of the eighteenth century,
created a music full of freshness, primitiveness
and transporting power, which
lived and died with the reformers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The three grand-masters, Palestrina,
Handel and Bach, equal, but do not rival
each other. We cannot judge them for the
different sentiments they indulged in. The
philosophers may settle which is the best
religion, for to the necessity of one they
all agree, but music cannot be chained by
dogmas. Heaven is an orb, whose centre
is everywhere. Palestrina’s music is
the language of the south, Handel’s and
Bach’s that of the north. Though one sun
illumes both lands—though one ether spans
both, yet in the south the sun is milder,
the ether purer. Flowers which there grow
in wild abundance, the north must obtain
by culture.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must think at our work.</p>

<p class='c006'>This necessity of thought is apparent in
religion, language and art, and can be
seen most clearly in the greatest works of
the German grand-masters, in Bach’s
“Matthew Passion,” and Handel’s “Israel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sebastian Bach’s astonishing dexterity
in thematical works is the reason that
even unto this day we do not find a symphony
or overture appropriate for a concert,
of which the single motive forming the
principal thought of the movement is not
worked up on the basis which he constructed
with such deep knowledge and
skill.</p>

<p class='c006'>To him we must retrace our steps, in
order to perceive the true nature of our
instrumental music, for we are as little
masters of the course of our ideas, as of
the circulation of the blood in our veins.
Centuries have passed, and although the
first great instrumental-piece—the overture—was
a French production, (Lulli was
the first master in this <i>genre</i> of art,) yet
Bach and Handel impressed the first decided
stamp upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Later, the overture was supplanted by
the symphony, for the reason that it was of
easier composition and execution than the
former. The overture consisted of a <i>grave</i>,
followed by a <i>fugue</i>. The symphony was
composed somewhat in the style of a <i>fugue</i>
and that of the lively dances of that time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shortly after this period, the dance-music
was thought no longer fashionable,
and was succeeded by two <i>Allegros</i>, with an
<i>Andante</i> or <i>Largo</i> placed between them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Father Hayden felt hurt at the complete
abandonment of dance-music, and again
adopted the minuet. Mozart also preferred
the grave and majestic dancing-step of his
ancestors, the minuet. But Beethoven’s
impetuous and passionate nature scoffed
at the slow and gracious movements of the
minuet, and revelled instead in the wild
Scherzo, or in the capricious demonical
leaps of the old <i>Passepied</i>. Dark and
mighty forms rose before the gloomy vision
of his inner-man, acting powerfully upon
the phantasy, and wherever they met this
volcanic fire, always leaving a deep impression.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Two comets ushered in the existence of
our century; the one revolutionized the
exterior—the other, the interior world.
Especially were the young generation
touched by the electric sparks of their
rays.</p>

<p class='c006'>Napoleon’s battles were repeated a thousand
times in the nurseries with lead and
paper soldiers. Beethoven’s melodies agitated
the souls of the young generation in
their working and dreaming hours. When
the shoes of the child became too small
they were thrown aside; the lead and
paper soldiers shared the same fate; but
the melodious tones grew with the soul to
more and more powerful chords. Beethoven’s
star shone brighter, while Napoleon’s
was already fading. Then we
heard that Beethoven intended to destroy
his great symphony called “Eroica.” Napoleon,
the consul, to whom Beethoven designed
to dedicate this great work, had
sunk to Napoleon the Emperor, and Beethoven
felt ashamed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Majesty of rank is often devoid of the
grace and majesty of the soul. The chord
e<sup>b</sup>, g, b<sup>b</sup> wherewith the bass solemnly introduced
the third symphony (Eroica), and
his inversions in the Scherzo b<sup>b</sup>, e<sup>b</sup>, g, b<sup>b</sup>,
and in the last movement e, b, b, e, this
echo of the Marseillaise suited no longer
and should perish with it. Only then,
when fate, in the icy deserts of Russia,
clasped the grand General in its iron grip,
and never loosened its hold until it had
crushed him, did the composer of the Eroica
comprehend that in the <i>marcia funebre</i>
contained in this symphony, he had spoken
in prophetic voice. The prophecy contained
in the last movement was destined
to be fulfilled in the latter half of this
century.</p>

<p class='c006'>As Beethoven poured out his soul in a
prophetic epopee, so did Mozart embody
his genius in his Don Giovanni. But as
the sublime always acts more powerfully
upon youth than knowledge and beauty, so
likewise was the success of Beethoven
greater than that of Mozart in this century.
Altogether Mozart is generally appreciated
better in riper years. “<i>La delicatesse
du gout est une première nuance de
la satiété.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mendelssohn, whose compositions ever
flowed smoothly and quietly, understood
well how to tune his harmonica to Mozart’s
tuning-fork.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. You represent Beethoven as grave
and solemn, and yet it appears he was not
a great despiser of dances. Take, for instance,
his A major symphony. Lively to
overflowing, almost mad with frantic joy,
is the first movement. Equal to a double
quick-step, the last, about as the peasants
of Saxony perform their dances, the Scherzo
gay; and in the Andante, he even calls
upon a lot of old bachelors and maiden-ladies,
with their hoop accompaniment, to
fall in and execute their <i>tours</i>?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. What opposite views are often taken
of the same thing by different minds! In
the andante, in which you find so much
humor, Marx observes the sober view of
life, at first the peaceful and untroubled
step, but growing ever more and more
painful, and suffering, fighting the battle
of life; yet, be this as it may, such
music is ever successful, even in spite of
the biting criticism of Maria v. Weber,
and the ferocious attacks of Oulibischeff.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. A good dance is always successful, I
believe?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. Mendelssohn knew this, as he also
understood Beethoven and the public, when
he wrote his dance overture, “A Summer-night’s
Dream.” Auber, Herold and
others wrote dance overtures <i>en masse</i>, and
we often find more piquant themes in them
than Beethoven’s A major symphony, or
Mendelssohn’s Summer-night’s Dream can
boast of, yet we do not prefer them for the
concert.</p>

<p class='c006'>All compositions for an orchestra, be
they overture or symphony, must first
contain a theme, which expresses the character
of the principal composition. Second,
the expansions of compositions in
the style of a symphony, must, according
to my opinion, originate from <i>one theme</i>,
germinate from <i>one</i> seed, growing larger
and stronger all the time, until the swelling
bud bursts into a beautiful blossom;
yet there must not be orange-blossoms on
an oak-tree; all must fit harmoniously.</p>

<p class='c006'>The theme, <i>sujet</i>, or <i>motive</i>, must be a
fixed idea, such as “love;” it must be ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>present—the first at day-break, the last at
night—no other impression must be strong
enough to erase it.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, by the blossom, you understand the
creation of a second thought, often called
the second theme, even this second theme
ought to be governed by the first, even
this blossom ought to glow in the same
colors. It must be so twined around the
heart of the composer, that nothing foreign
could possibly enter it. Merely thematical
productions are exercises for the pupil;
compositions which merely contain parts
composed by rule, are merely a musical
exercise. Lobe certainly is wrong, if he
thus teaches the art of composing.</p>

<p class='c006'>True, it is easy to point out how one
part belongs here, the other there, yet the
composition must be a free expression of
the soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>Third—The finishing of the same.
This must also be governed in its main
parts by the predominating feeling, and
only minor thoughts and impressions must
be used by the composer to fill up or cast
away.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us now turn, for illustration, to the
theme of Wagner’s overture to Faustus.
In the introduction we first see it in the
eighth measure, very moderate, in the
dominant d minor, commencing with the
notes a ā | b<sup>b</sup> b<sup>b</sup>. a | g <i>sharp</i>, and headed
“very expressive,” concerning which Von
Bulow observes, that it truly expresses the
feeling and character of the last lines of
the motto which Wagner chose at the
heading:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thus life to me a dire burden is;</div>
      <div class='line'>Existence I despise, for death I wish.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>If we designate the above-mentioned
theme by figure I. we must name the
figure which already makes its appearance
in the second measure, and which is of the
utmost importance, to wit, d <i>sharp</i>, e, f, f,
e, e, b, b, figure II., the first theme having
been expressed by the violin, the second
figure reappears again in the tenth measure,
executed by the viola, growling like a
furiously racked demon, while the wind instruments,
flute, oboe and clarionet, “very
expressive,” and yet full of sympathizing
sorrow, intervene at the last quarter of
the tenth measure with the motive, which
we will call figure III. Figure II. continues
rumbling in the quartette, relieved
by another figure (IV.) descending
from above, which is introduced by the
second violin in the fourteenth measure.
Figure IV. now extends itself further above
a chromatic bass, until in the nineteenth
measure, in d major, a clear and distinct
new motive, gentle and forgiving in character
(V.) makes its appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>These five motives which the composer
so exquisitely leads before us, in his very
moderate introduction, now receive the
finishing-touch in the allegro. Thus speaks
Von Bulow.</p>

<p class='c006'>Truly, as Goethe says: “If you perform
a piece, be sure to perform the same in
pieces.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I will pass over the introduction, though
I have as little taste for such “theme
pieces” succeeding each other, as for
Opera-overtures, such as that of Tannhäuser,
where pilgrim-songs, the love-sick
murmurings of the voluptuous Venus,
and the tedious Count’s drawling sorrow
for his only daughter and heir, form a
hash, which in the details, and in the
heterogeneous compilation of the same, is
unpalatable enough, but which is made unbearable
by the soul-killing figures—no!
not figures, but by the up and down strokes
of monotonous bases, which continue for
about sixty measures. Setting aside even
all this, we may justly expect in the allegro
the expansion of the principle theme I.,
yet we have no such thing; in place of the
“idea” he produces after the first five measures
a worthless figure, fit for accompaniment
only, which is supported on its tottering
basis by the twenty-seven times repeated
downstroke of the conductor only.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. Excuse me; but the tone-picture,
which Von Bulow, R. Wagner’s friend and
admirer, calls the forgiving voice (III), reappears
twice in wind-instrument music?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. According to Lobe’s system. Borrow
a measure or two from a theme, then
a motive, which you may construct from
this or that or a third figure, and you have,
besides the required unity, the grandest
variation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Do you know, my young friend, what a
composer understands by an exploded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>idea? The technical! All who study the
art of composing, as Lobe teaches it, may
learn to become <i>compilers</i> but <i>not composers</i>;
or they must drink elder-tea, till
their visions appear black and blue to
them, in order to evaporate the schooling
they enjoyed. After twenty-seven measures
of earthly smoke, there appears a
solitary star, theme I., continuing for four
whole measures, followed by a little more
mist.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. No; I think Bulow says the mist is
parted by a firm and punctuated motive.</p>

<p class='c006'>A. If it is not firm, it is at least <i>fortissimo</i>.
Enough, we again hear thirteen
measures of unimportant music, concluded
by d minor, followed by a new melody for
a hautboy, which, as it repeats the two
first notes of the first theme, may claim to
be considered as belonging there, leading
to a third in f major, in company with a
tremulando, <i>à la Samiel</i>, crescendo and
diminuendo. We have now arrived at the
point where we may look for the second
theme, “the blossom,” as we before said,
but alas, in vain your tortured soul waits, no
blossoms! The thermometer sinks again!
With the cadence we again hear theme I.,
after four measures we find ourselves once
more in d <i>flat</i> major—no, in a minor, b
<i>flat</i> major or b <i>flat</i> minor, or g minor, it is
difficult to say which, for this part may
be said to belong in the “most inseparably
combined, the closest related family
of all keys.” Enough, we find ourselves
after twenty-six measures exactly at the
very place we started from, before the performance
of twenty-six measures, namely,
in f major.</p>

<p class='c006'>This movement of twenty-six measures
might be wholly thrown out, without one
being any wiser—a possibility which, in
every good composition, must be looked
upon as a great fault, as all parts must be
so closely united as to enforce the presence
and support of each other.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will now look at the second theme.
In it no critic can find a fault. It unravels
itself smoothly, and, after forty-nine
measures, conducts us again to motive V.
in the introduction, as likewise to figure
II., which here does not frown quite so
much.</p>

<p class='c006'>Figure V. first appears in f, after twenty-two
measures in g <i>flat</i> major, after fourteen
more in A minor, after thirty-four in d
minor, and after another thirty-nine
measures we at last hear theme I. again,
in the dominant of the bass, a Faustus
with lantern jaws, sunken temples, sparse
hair, but with a very, very magnificent
bread-basket.</p>

<p class='c006'>The blossom is larger than the whole
tree. If it is not a miracle, it is a wonderful
abortion. Are you now curious as
to the second part? Oh! it almost appears
like a fugue, the bass dies away, a
fifth higher the cello commences, another
fifth higher the viola in unison with the
second violin; but as the composer has
strayed already from d minor to b minor, he
does not think it safe to stray further; the
wind instruments continue by themselves
in figure II.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. Bulow says the cello and viola united,
once more introduce the principal
theme.</p>

<p class='c006'>A. Just so. After the bassoon has tried
twice to begin the same, after about thirty
measures of worldly ether, more devoid
of stars than the South Pole, it is headed
“wild!” The leading theme once
more begins in the principal tonic (d
minor), etc., afterwards enlarged, the
first two notes converted, caught up by
the cello and the trumpet, wherein the
bass-trombone is expected to perform the
high A, and after twenty-eight measures of
“hated existence” the second theme in d
major, together with the finale, appears
like a short bright ray of the glorious sun
on a misty winter day.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Cannot shake the outer towers”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>is Wagner’s motto, which he has justly
chosen for the heading of his overture,
and I attempt no alteration only at the
conclusion, and close with—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Q. Bulow would also answer as Goethe:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To understand and write of living things,</div>
      <div class='line'>Try first to drive away the soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>parts</i> will then remain within your hand!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A. I have never found fault with these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>parts, excepting, perhaps, that I said the
working out of the second theme is, in
proportion to the first theme, too extensive;
in fact, there is nothing of the future
contained in the overture.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q. No future?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. I mean to say, no music of the future—not
even a chromatic scale for the fundamental
key—it moves entirely in the common
form:</p>

<p class='c016'>Principal theme—d minor;</p>

<p class='c017'>Second theme—f major;</p>

<p class='c017'>Return to fundamental key;</p>

<p class='c017'>Second theme—d major, and conclusion
in this key.</p>

<p class='c010'>The finish and working up is neat and
careful, and many pretty and uncommon
effects occur therein; still I do not think
the same in its proper place for a concert.</p>

<p class='c006'>It inherits nothing of the Bach; the <i>piece</i>
is well constructed, yet the <i>small pieces</i>
cannot escape criticism. Even Beethoven,
in the first movements of his <i>Eroica</i> makes
us acquainted with all the parts he intends
to work up, and in his c minor symphony
he says plainly: Now observe; the notes g
g g e <i>flat</i> compose the whole, nothing
more. But after that it is a rushing flow,
an unbroken ring and song, pressing
breathlessly onward, which captivates and
carries us along with its force. To express
myself plainly, I may say that we can perceive
the work <i>was done</i> before it began.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is true, and I will not deny that even
he applied the file to heighten its polish,
yet the whole structure stood finished to
his vision before even these first four
notes were penned.</p>

<p class='c006'>No doubt R. Wagner also imagined a
picture before he painted it, but surely no
musical one; the poetry was there—the
music had to be manufactured. It is full
of genius, and not untrue; but he does
not allow sufficient freedom to the different
instruments, and is, consequently, not
sufficiently “obligato.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The parts succeed, instead of going in
company or against each other.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although now one, then another instrument
catches up a thought, yet the whole
appears more like a Quartette of Pleyel
than one of Beethoven’s—the overture is
not thought out polyphonically. Many,
however, do not know what Polyphonism
is; it has been written about in many curious
ways. The pupil will best learn to
write music in a polyphonic manner, if, at
the commencement, he invents at once a
double-voiced movement, but in such a
manner that one voice is not the subordinate
of the other; both are equally necessary
to represent the meaning of the
thought he wishes to express.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this manner he may or must continue
in regard to the three or four-voiced movements
likewise.</p>

<p class='c006'>The addition of voices to a melody satisfactory
in itself, be they ever so well
flourished, cannot properly be called polyphonism.</p>

<p class='c006'>Polyphonism, however, should be the
ruling principle in all orchestral concert
compositions, although in some points, for
instance, in the second theme, homophony
may take its place.</p>

<p class='c006'>A well composed symphony or overture
must not entertain the audience only, but
every performing musician must feel that
he is not an instrument or a machine, but a
living and intelligent being.</p>

<p class='c006'>The overture to Faustus so entirely ignores
Polyphony, that it seems a virtual
denial of its effectiveness and importance
in orchestral composition.</p>

<p class='c006'>Richard Wagner will never become a
composer of instrumental music, but in
his operas he has opened a new avenue,
and his creations therein are something
grand and sublime.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>SCHOPENHAUER’S DOCTRINE OF THE WILL. <br /> Translated from the German, by <span class='sc'>C. L. Bernays</span>.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>[We print below a condensed statement of the central doctrine of Arthur Schopenhauer. It
is translated from his work entitled “<i>Ueber den Willen in der Natur</i>,” 2d ed., 1854, Frankfort—pp.
19-23, and 63. To those familiar with the kernel of speculative truth, it is unnecessary
to remark that the basis of the system herewith presented is thoroughly speculative, and resembles
in some respects that of Leibnitz in the Monadology, printed in our last number. It
is only an attempt to solve all problems through self-determination, and this in its immediate
form as the will. Of course the immediateness (i. e. lack of development or realization) of the
principle employed here, leads into difficulty, and renders it impossible for him to see the close relation
he stands in to other great thinkers. Hence he uses very severe language when speaking
of other philosophers. If the Will is taken for the “Radical of the Soul,” then other forms of
self-determination, e. g. the grades of knowing, will not be recognized as possessing substantiality,
and hence the theoretical mind will be subordinated to the practical;—a result, again, which
is the outcome of the Philosophy of Fichte. But Leibnitz seizes a more general <i>aperçu</i>, and identifies
self-determination with cognition in its various stages; and hence he rises to the great
principle of Recognition as the form under which all finitude is cancelled—all multiplicity preserved
in the unity of the Absolute.—<span class='sc'>Editor.</span>]</p>

<p class='c010'>The idea of a soul as a metaphysical being,
in whose absolute simplicity will and
intellect were an indissoluble unity, was a
great and permanent impediment to all
deeper insight into natural phenomena.
The cardinal merit of my doctrine, and
that which puts it in opposition to all the
former philosophies, is the perfect separation
of the will from the intellect. All
former philosophers thought will to be inseparable
from the intellect; the will was
declared to be conditioned upon the intellect,
or even to be a mere function of it,
whilst the intellect was regarded as the
fundamental principle of our spiritual existence.
I am well aware that to the future
alone belongs the recognition of this
doctrine, but to the future philosophy the
separation, or rather the decomposition of
the soul into two heterogeneous elements,
will have the same significance as the decomposition
of water had to chemistry.
Not the soul is the eternal and indestructible
or the very principle of life in men,
but what I might call the Radical of the
soul, and that is the <i>Will</i>. The so-called
soul is already a compound; it is the combination
of will and the νοῦς, intellect.
The intellect is the secondary, the <i>posterius</i>
in any organism, and, as a mere function of
the brain, dependent upon the organism.
The will, on the contrary, is primary, the
<i>prius</i> of the organism, and the organism
consequently is conditioned by it. For the
will is the very “thing in itself,” which in
conception (that is, in the peculiar function
of the brain) exhibits itself as an organic
body. Only by virtue of the forms
of cognition, that is, by virtue of that
function of the brain—hence only in conception—one’s
body is something extended
and organic, not outside of it, or immediately
in self-consciousness. Just as the
various single acts of the body are nothing
but the various acts of the will portrayed
in the represented world, just so is the
shape of this body as a totality the image
of its will as a whole. In all organic functions
of the body, therefore, just as in its
external actions, the will is the “<i>agens</i>.”
True physiology, on its height, shows the
intellect to be the product of the physical
organization, but true metaphysics show,
that physical existence itself is the product,
or rather the appearance, of a spiritual
<i>agens</i>, to-wit, the will; nay, that matter
itself is conditioned through conception,
in which alone it exists. Perception and
thought may well be explained by the nature
of the organism; the will never can
be; the contrary is true, namely, that every
organism originates by and from the
will. This I show as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>I therefore posit the will as the “thing
in itself”—as something absolutely primitive;
secondly, the simple visibility of the
will, its objectivation as our body; and
thirdly, the intellect as a mere function of
a certain part of that body. That part
(the brain) is the objectivated desire
(or will) to know, which became represented:
for the will, to reach its ends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>needs the intellect. This function again
pre-supposes the whole world as representation;
it therefore pre-supposes also
the body as an object, and even matter itself,
so far as existing only in representation,
for an objective world without a subject
in whose intellect it stands, is, well
considered, something altogether unthinkable.
Hence intellect and matter (subject
and object) only relatively exist for each
other, and in that way constitute the apparent
world.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whenever the will acts on external matter,
or whenever it is directed towards a
known object, thus passing through the
medium of knowledge, then all recognize
that the <i>agens</i>, which here is in action, is
the will, and they call it by that name.
Yet, that is will not less which acts in the
inner process that precedes those external
actions as their condition, which create and
preserve the organic life and its substrate;
and secretion, digestion, and the circulation
of the blood, are its work also. But
just because the will was recognized only
while leaving the individual from which it
started, and directing itself to the external
world, which precisely for that purpose
now appears as perception, the intellect
was regarded as its essential condition, as
its sole element, and as the very substance
out of which it was made, and thereby the
very worst <i>hysteron proteron</i> was committed
that ever happened.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before all, one should know how to discriminate
between will and arbitrariness
(<i>Wille und Willkühr</i>), and one should understand
that the first can exist without
the second. Will is called arbitrariness
where it is lighted by intellect, and whenever
motives or conceptions are its moving
causes; or, objectively speaking, whenever
external causes which produce an act are
mediated by a brain. The motive may be
defined as an external irritation, by whose
influence an image is formed in the brain,
and under the mediation of which the will
accomplishes its effect, that is, an external
act of the body. With the human species
the place of that image may be occupied
by a concept, which being formed from images
of a similar kind, by omitting the
differences, is no longer intuitive, but only
marked and fixed by words. Hence as the
action of motives is altogether independent
of any contact, they therefore can
measure their respective forces upon the
will, on each other, and thereby permit a
certain choice. With the animals, that
choice is confined to the narrow horizon of
what is visibly projected before them;
among men it has the wide range of the
<i>thinkable</i>, or of its concepts, as its sphere.
Those movements, therefore, which result
from motives, and not from causes, as in
the inorganic world, nor from mere irritation,
as with the plants, are called arbitrary
movements. These motives pre-suppose
knowledge, the medium of the motives,
through which in this case causality
is effected, irrespective of their absolute
necessity in any other respect. Physiologically,
the difference between irritation
and motive may be described thus:
Irritation excites a reaction <i>immediately</i>,
the reaction issuing from the same part
upon which the irritation had acted; whilst
a motive is an irritation, which must make
a circuit through the brain, where first an
image is formed, and that image then originates
the ensuing reaction, which now is
called an act of the free will. Hence the
difference between free and unfree movements
does not concern the essential and
primary, which in both is the will, but only
the secondary, that is, the way in which
the will is aroused; to-wit, whether it
shows itself in consequence of some real
cause, or of an irritation, or of a motive,
that is, of a cause that had to pass through
the organ of the intellect.</p>

<p class='c006'>Free will or arbitrariness is only possible
in the consciousness of men. It differs
from the consciousness of animals in this,
that it contains not only present and tangible
representations, but abstract concepts,
which, independent of the differences
of time, act simultaneously and side by
side, permitting thereby conviction or a
conflict of motives; this, in the strictest
sense of the word, is called free will. Yet
this very free will or choice consists only
in the victory of the stronger motive over
a weaker in a given individual character,
by which the ensuing action was determined,
just as one impulse is overpowered by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>a stronger counter impulse, whereby the effect
nevertheless appears with the same necessity
as the movement of a stone that
has received an impulse. The great thinkers
of all times agree in this decidedly;
while, on the contrary, the vulgar will
little understand the great truth, that the
mark of our liberty is not to be found in
our single acts, but in our existence itself,
and in its very essence. Whenever one has
succeeded to discriminate will from free
will, or the arbitrary, and to consider the
latter as a peculiar species of the former,
then there is no more room for any difficulty
in discovering the will also in occurrences
wherein intelligence cannot be
traced.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c006'>The will is the original. It has created
the world, but not through the medium of
an intellect either outside or inside of
the world, for we know of the intellect only
through the mediation of the animal world,
the very last in creation. The will itself,
the unintentional will which is discovered
in everything, is the creator of the world.
The animals, therefore, are organized in
accordance with their mode of living,
and their mode of living is not shaped in
conformity with their organs; the structure
of any animal is the result of its will
to be what it is. Nature, which never lies,
tells us the same in its <i>naïve</i> way; it lets
any being just kindle the first spark of its
life on one of his equals, and then lets it
finish itself before our eyes. The form and
the movement it takes from its own self,
the substance from outside. This is called
growth and development. Thus even empirically
do all beings stand before us as
their own work; but the language of nature
is too simple, and therefore but few
understand it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cognition, since all motives are dependent
on it, is the essential characteristic of
the animal kingdom. When animal life
ceases, cognition ceases also; and arrived
at that point, we can comprehend the medium
by which the influences from the external
world on the movements of other
beings are effected only by analogy, whilst
the will, which we have recognized as the
basis and as the very kernel of all beings,
always and everywhere remains the same.
On the low stage of the vegetable world,
and of the vegetative life in the animal
organizations, it is <i>irritation</i>, and in the
inorganic world it is the mechanical relation
in general which appears as the substitute
or as the analogue of the intellect.
We cannot say that the plants perceive the
light and the sun, but we see that they are
differently affected by the presence or absence
of the sun, and that they turn themselves
towards it; and though in fact that
movement mostly coincides with their
growth, like the rotation of the moon with
its revolution, that movement nevertheless
exists, and the direction of the growth of
a plant is just in the same way determined
and systematically modified as an action is
by a motive. Inasmuch, therefore, as a
plant has its wants, though not of the kind
which require a sensorium or an intellect,
something analogous must take their place
to enable the will to seize at least a supply
offered to it, if not to go in quest of it.
This is the susceptibility for irritation,
which differs from the intellect, in that
the motive and subsequent act of volition
are clearly separated from each other,
and the clearer, the more perfect the intellect
is; whilst at the mere susceptibility
for an irritation, the feeling of the irritation
and the resulting volition can no
longer be discriminated. In the inorganic
world, finally, even the susceptibility
for irritation, whose analogy with the intellect
cannot be mistaken, ceases, and
there remains nothing but the varied reaction
of the bodies against the various influences.
This reaction is the substitute
for the intellect. Whenever the reaction
of a body differs from another, the influence
also must be different, creating a different
affection, which even in its dullness
yet shows a remote analogy with the intellect.
If, for instance, the water in an embankment
finds an issue and eagerly precipitates
itself through it, it certainly does
not perceive the break, just as the acid
does not perceive the alkali, for which it
leaves the metal; yet we must confess
that what in all these bodies has effected
such sudden changes, has a certain
resemblance with that which moves ourselves
whenever we act in consequence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>an unexpected motive. We therefore see
that the intellect appears as the medium of
our motives, that is, as the medium of
causality in regard to intellectual beings,
as that which receives the change from the
external world, and which must be followed
by a change in ourselves, as the mediator
between both. On this narrow line, balances
the whole world as representation,
i. e. that whole extensive world in space
and time, which as such cannot be anywhere
else but in our brain, just as dreams;
for the periods of their duration stand on
the very same basis. Whatever to the animals
and to man is given by his intellect as
a medium of the motives, the same is given
to the plants by their susceptibility for irritation,
and to inorganic bodies by their
reaction on the various causes, which in
fact only differ in respect to the degree of
volition; for, just in consequence of the
fact, that in proportion to their wants the
susceptibility for external impressions was
raised to such a degree in the animals that
a brain and a system of nerves had to develop
itself, did consciousness, moreover,
originate as a function of this
brain, and in this consciousness the whole
objective world, whose forms (time,
space and causality) are the rules for the
exercise of this function. We therefore
discover that the intellect is calculated
only for the subjective, merely to be a servant
of the will, appearing only “<i>per accidens</i>”
as a condition of animal life, where
motives take the place of irritation. The
picture of the external world, which at this
stage enters into the forms of time and
space, is but the background on which motives
represent themselves as ends; it is
also the condition of the connection of the
external objects in regard to space and
causality, but yet is nothing else but
the mediation and the tie between the motive
and the will. What a leap would it
be to take this picture to be the true,
ultimate essence of things,—this image of
the world, which originates accidentally in
the intellect as a function of animal brains,
whereby the means to their ends are shown
them, and their ways on this planet cleared
up! What a temerity to take this image
and the connection of its parts to be the
absolute rule of the world, the relations of
the things in themselves—and to suppose
that all that could just as well exist independently
of our brain! And yet this
supposition is the very ground on which
all the dogmatical systems previous to Kant
were based, for it is the implicit pre-supposition
of their Ontology, Cosmology,
Theology, and of all their Eternal Verities.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this realistic examination we have
gained very unexpectedly the <i>objective</i>
point of view of Kant’s immortal discovery,
arriving by our empirical, physiological
way to the same point whence Kant
started with his transcendental criticism.
Kant made the subjective his basis, positing
consciousness; but from its <i>à priori</i>
nature he comes to the result, that all that
happens in it can be nothing else but representation.
We, on the contrary, starting
from the objective, have discovered what
are the ends and the origin of the intellect,
and to what class of phenomena it belongs.
We discover in <i>our</i> way, that the intellect
is limited to mere representations, and that
what is exhibited in it is conditioned by
the subject, that is, a <i>mundane phenomenon</i>,
and that just in the same way the order
and the connection of all external
things is conditioned by the subject, and
is never a knowledge of what they are in
themselves, and how they may be connected
with each other. We, in our way, like
Kant in his, have discovered that the world
as representation, balances on that narrow
line between the external cause (motive)
and the produced effect (act of will) of intelligent
(animal) beings, where the clear
discrimination of the two commences. <i>Ita
res accendent lumina rebus.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Our objective stand-point is realistic, and
therefore conditioned, inasmuch as starting
from natural beings as posited, we have
abstracted from the circumstance that their
objective existence presupposes an intellect,
in which they find themselves as representations;
but Kant’s subjective and
idealistic stand-point is equally conditioned,
inasmuch as it starts from the intellect,
which itself is conditioned by nature,
in consequence of whose development
up to the animal world it only comes
into existence. Holding fast to this, our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span><i>realistic-objective</i> stand-point, Kant’s doctrine
may be characterized thus: after
Locke had abstracted the <i>rôle</i> of the senses,
under the name of “secondary properties,”
for the purpose of distinguishing things in
themselves from things as they appear,
Kant, with far greater profundity, abstracted
the <i>rôle</i> of the brain functions [conceptions
of the understanding]—a less considerable
<i>rôle</i> than that of the senses—and
thus abstracted as belonging to the subjective
all that Locke had included under
the head of primary properties. I, on the
other hand, have merely shown why all
stands thus in relation, by exhibiting the
position which the intellect assumes in the
System of Nature when we start realistically
from the objective as a datum, and
take the <span class='sc'>Will</span>, of which alone we are immediately
conscious, as the true που στῶ of
all metaphysics—as the essence of which
all else is only the phenomenon.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY.</h3>
<h4 class='c012'>CHAPTER VII. <br /> COMPREHENSION AND IDEA.</h4>
<h4 class='c012'>I.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Everything, to be known, must be thought
as belonging to a system. This result was
the conclusion of Chapter VI. To illustrate:
acid is that which hungers for a
base; its sharp taste is the hunger itself;
it exists only in a tension. Hence to think
an acid we must think a base; the base is
ideally in the acid, and is the cause of its
sharpness. The union of the acid and
base gives us a salt, and in the salt we cannot
taste the acid nor the base distinctly,
for each is thoroughly modified by the
other, each is <i>cancelled</i>. We separate the
acid and base again and there exist two
contradictions—acid and base—each calling
for the other, each asserting its complement
to be itself. For the properties of
a somewhat are its <i>wants</i>, i. e. what it lacks
of the total.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such elements of a total as we are here
considering, have been called “<i>moments</i>”
by Hegel. The total is the “<i>negative unity</i>”
(See Chap. IV.)</p>

<p class='c006'>In the illustration we have salt as the
negative unity of the moments, acid and
base. The unity is called <i>negative</i> because
its existence destroys each of the
moments by adding the other to it. After
the negative unity exists, each of the moments
is no longer in a tension, but has become
thoroughly modified by the other.
The negative unity is <i>ideal</i> when the moments
are held asunder—it is then potential,
and through it each moment has its
own peculiar properties.</p>

<p class='c006'>More generally: every somewhat is <i>determined</i>
by another; its characteristic,
therefore, is the manifestation of its other
or of the complement which makes with it
the total or negative unity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The complete thought of any somewhat
includes the phases or moments, as such,
and their negative unity. This may properly
be called the <i>comprehension</i>. To
comprehend [<i>Begreifen</i>] we must seize
the object in its totality; com-prehend
= to seize together, just as con-ceive =
to take together; but conception is generally
used in English to signify a picture of
the object more or less general. Not the
totality, but only some of its characteristics,
are grasped together in a conception.
Hence conceptions are <i>subjective</i>,
i. e. they do not correspond to the true
object in its entirety; but comprehension
is <i>objective</i> in the sense that everything in
its true existence is a comprehension.
With this distinction between conception
and comprehension most people would
deny, at once, the possibility of the latter
as an act of human intelligence. Sensuous
knowing—for the reason that it attributes
validity to isolated objects—does not
comprehend. Reflective knowing seizes
the reciprocal relations, but not in the
negative unity. Comprehension—whether
one ever can arrive at it or not—should be
the thought in its totality, wherein negative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>unity and moments are thought together.
Thus a true comprehension is the
thought of the self-determined, and we
have not thoroughly comprehended any
thing till we have traced it back through
its various presuppositions to self-determination
which must always be the form of
the total. (See chapters IV. &amp; V.)</p>
<h4 class='c012'>II.</h4>
<p class='c005'>The name “Idea” is reserved for the
deepest thought of Philosophy.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a> In <i>comprehension</i>
we think a system of dependent
moments in a negative unity. Thus in
the comprehension the multiplicity of elements,
thought in the moments, is destroyed
in its negative unity, and there is, consequently,
only one independent being or
totality. Let, once, each of these moments
develop to a totality, so that we have in
each a repetition of the whole, and we
shall have a comprehension of comprehensions—a
system of totalities—and this is
what Hegel means by “<i>Idee</i>,” or Idea.
Plato arrives at this, but does not consistently
develop it. He deals chiefly with
the standpoint of comprehension, and
hence has much that is <i>dialectical</i>. (The
Dialectic is the process which arises when
the abstract and incomplete is put under
the form of the true, or the apodeictic. To
refute a category of limited application,
make it universal and it will contradict
itself. Thus the “Irony” of Socrates consists
in generously (!) assuming of any
category all that his interlocutor wishes,
and then letting it refute itself while he
applies it in this and that particular instance
with the air of one who sincerely
believes in it. Humor is of this nature;
the author assumes the validity of the
character he is portraying in regard to his
weak points, and then places him in positions
wherein these weaknesses prove their
true nature.) Aristotle, on the other hand,
writes from the standpoint of the <i>Idea</i>
constantly, and therefore treats his subjects
as systematic totalities independent
of each other; this gives the appearance
of empiricism to his writings. The following
illustration of the relation of comprehension
to idea may be of assistance
here:</p>

<p class='c006'>Let any totality = T be composed of elements,
phases or moments = a + b + c + d,
&amp;c. Each of these moments, a, b, c, &amp;c.,
differs from the others and from the total;
they are in a negative unity just as acid
and base are, in a salt. The assertion of
the negative unity cancels each of the moments.
The negative unity adds to <i>a</i> the
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>, which it lacks of the total; for
a = T - b - c - &amp;c.; and so too b = T - a - c
- d - &amp;c., and c = T - a - b - &amp;c. Each demands
all the rest to make its existence
possible, just as the acid cannot exist
if its tension is not balanced by a base.
So far we have the Comprehension.
If, now, we consider these moments as
being able to develop, like the Monads of
Leibnitz, we shall have the following result:
<i>a</i> will absorb <i>b</i> + <i>c</i> + <i>d</i> + <i>&amp;c.</i>, and thus
become a totality and a negative unity for
itself; <i>b</i> may do likewise, and thus the
others. Under this supposition we have,
instead of the first series of moments (a +
b + c + d + &amp;c.) a new series wherein
each moment has developed to a total by
supplying its deficiencies thus: a b c d
&amp;c., + b a c d &amp;c., + c a b d &amp;c., +
d a b c &amp;c. In the new series, each
term is a negative unity and a totality,
and hence no longer exists in a tension,
and no longer can be cancelled by the
negative unity. Such a system of terms
would offer us a manifold of individuals,
and yet a profound unity. This is the
unity of the Idea, and it affords a concrete
multiplicity. Leibnitz gives to his Monads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the power of reflection, so that each is the
mirror of the universe; hence, in each is
found the whole, and the Totality is endlessly
repeated; “everywhere the one and
the all”—and this is the “preestablished
harmony,” no doubt. This is the highest
point of view in philosophy—true multiplicity
and true unity coexisting. Plato
reaches it in his statement in the Timaeus,
that “God has made the world most like
himself, since he <i>in nowise possesses envy</i>.”
The ultimate purpose of the universe is
the reflection of God to himself. In this
reflection, the existence of independent
self-determining totalities is presupposed;
to all else he is a negative unity, and
therefore destructive. To the righteous,
i. e. to those who perfect themselves by
performing for themselves the function of
negative unity, He says: “In you I am
well pleased; I am reflected in you.” But
to the wicked he is a consuming fire, for
they do not assume the function of negative
unity, but leave it to be used toward
them from outside. Thus, too, the lower
orders of existence perish through this,
that their negative unity is not within but
without. If God is conceived merely as
the negative unity, and the creature not as
self-determining, we have the standpoint
of Pantheism. It is the Brahm which becomes
all, and all returns into him again.
If we had such a God we should only <i>seem</i>
to be, for when he looked at us and “placed
us under the form of Eternity” we should
vanish. But in culture each of us absorbs
his “not me,” just as “a,” in the illustration
given above, became a b c d &amp;c.
Its <i>a</i>-ness was destroyed by its modifying
(“rounding off”) its own peculiarity by
the peculiarities of the rest, and thus becoming
“cosmopolitan.” This is justly
esteemed the profoundest and most sacred
dogma of the Christian Religion when
stated as the doctrine of the Trinity. The
completest unity there obtains of independent
individualities. All higher forms of
spirit repeat the same thought. Government,
e. g. is the Legislative, the Judiciary,
and the Executive. Resist the Judiciary
and it can, in the exercise of its function,
assume executive powers. Each
power is the entire organism viewed from
the standpoint of one of its phases, just
as <i>a b c</i>, <i>b a c</i>, <i>c a b</i>, are the same totality,
but with different starting points assumed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The self-determining being is the being
which is its own other, and hence is its own
negative unity. Thus it can never be a
simple moment of a higher being, but is
essentially a <i>reflection</i> of it. Recognition
is the highest deed; it belongs to the standpoint
of the Idea. Upon the plane of comprehension,
the unity and multiplicity are
mutually destructive; upon the plane of
Idea they are mutually affirmative. The
more creatures in whom he can be reflected,
the more affirmations of God there are.
The human spirit grows solely through recognition.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c006'><i>Remark.</i> This is the only standpoint
that is absolutely affirmative—all others
being more or less negative, and, as a consequence,
self-opposed. The stage of <i>human
culture</i> is the most concrete illustration
of it. Three human beings—A, B, and
C—meet and form a community. As physical
beings they exclude, each the others.
The more one eats, the less the others have
to eat. But spiritually it is the reverse:
each has a different experience, and their
giving and taking, instead of diminishing
any one’s share, <i>increases</i> it. The experience
of A is imparted to B, and conversely;
and so also both share with C. By
this, C grows through the culture of A and
B, and becomes C B A; B develops to B
C A, and A to A C B; all is gain: no loss,
except of <i>poverty</i>. Limitation by another
makes a finite being. But self-determination
is the process of being one’s own
“other” or limit, and hence all self-determined
beings are totalities or microcosms,
which, though independent, reflect
each other, i. e. they make themselves in
the same image. Hence the “Preëstablished
Harmony” exists among such beings.
Each is its own negative. Cognition
or mind is the form of being which
embodies this.</p>

<p class='c006'>In culture we have an absolutely affirmative
process, for the reason that the <i>negative</i>,
involved in the cancelling of one’s
own idiosyncracies, is a negative of what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>is already negative. Hence the unity of
God is not in anywise impaired by the existence
of a continually increasing number
of perfected beings. In proportion to their
perfection they reflect Him, and their complete
self-determination is just that complete
realization of Him which completes
his self-consciousness. This has been
called Pantheism by those who confound
this standpoint with that of the Comprehension.
Pantheism is impossible with a
proper insight into the nature of self-consciousness.
A blind force fulfilling its
destiny, and giving rise to various orders
of beings which are to be re-absorbed by
it,—if one fancies this to be God, call him
a Pantheist, for God is then merely a negative
unity, and creation is only a series
of <i>moments</i>. But if one considers God
to be the Absolute Person, and deduces all
Theology from His self-consciousness, as
Hegel does, he cannot be called a Pantheist
consistently by any one who believes in
the Gospel of St. John. It is easy to see
why Hegel has been and still is regarded
as a Pantheist. When he asserts the self-consciousness
of the creature to be the
completion of the Divine self-consciousness,
Hegel merely states the logical constituents
of the Christian idea of the Trinity.
The “creature” is the <i>Son</i>, which is
“in the beginning.” All time must have
presented and still presents the development
of creatures into self-conscious beings.
Our planet began a short time since to do
this. “The fullness of time had come,”
and the final stage of reflection (which
must always have existed in the Universe)
began on the earth, or, to state it theologically,
“The Son was sent to redeem this
world.” To think that Hegel could regard
God as becoming conscious in time—as
passing from an unconscious state to a
conscious one—is to suppose him the
weakest of philosophers. <i>Self-consciousness</i>
cannot be “in time,” for it is the
“form of eternity,” and thus time is not
relative to it. The “fleeting show” of
History does not touch the self-consciousness
of God, nor does it touch any self-conscious
being “whose soul is builded
far from accident.”</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CHAPTER VIII. <br /> WHAT IS THE TRUE ACTUAL?</h4>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='fss'>I.</span>—<i>Reality and Potentiality.</i></h4>
<p class='c005'>The immediate object before the senses
undergoes change; the real becomes potential,
and that which was potential becomes
real. Without the potentiality we
could have had no change. At first we are
apt to consider the real as the entire existence
and to ignore the potential; but
the potential will not be treated thus.
Whatever a thing <i>can</i> become is as valid
as what it is already. The properties of a
thing by which it exists for us, are its relations
to other beings, and hence are
rather its <i>deficiencies</i> than its being <i>per se</i>.
Thus the sharpness in the acid was pronounced
to be the hunger of the same for
alkali; the sharper it was, the louder was its
call for alkali. Thus the very concreteness
of a thing is rather the process of its potentialities.
To illustrate this: we have a
circle of possibilities belonging to a thing—only
one of them is real at a time; it is,
for instance, water, whose potentialities
are vapor, liquid, and solid. Its reality is
only a part of its total being, as in the
case of water it was only one-third of
itself at any given temperature. Yet the
real is throughout qualified by the potential.
In change, the real is being acted
upon by the potential under the form
of “outside influences.” The pyramid
is not air, but the air continually acts
upon it, and the pyramid is in a continual
process of decomposition; its potentiality
is continually exhibiting its nature.
We know by seeing a thing undergo change
what its potentialities are. In the process
of change is manifested the activity of the
potentialities which are thus negative to it.
If a thing had no negative it would not
change. The real is nothing but the surface
upon which the potential writes its
nature; it is the field of strife between
the potentialities. The real persists in existence
through the potential which is in
continual process with it. Thus we are
led to regard the product of the two as the
constant. This we call <i>Actuality</i>.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>
  <h4 class='c012'><span class='fss'>II.</span>—<i>Actuality.</i></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The actual is a process, and is ever the
same; its two sides, are the real and the
potential, and the real is manifested no
more and no less than the potentialities, in
the process which constantly goes on. The
real is annulled by the potential, and
the latter becomes the real, only to be
again replaced. If in the circle of possibilities
which make up the entire being
of a thing, that which is real bears a small
proportion to the rest, the real is very unstable,
for the potentialities are to that
extent actively negative to it. But let the
sphere of the real be relatively large, and
we have a more stable being—there is less
to destroy it and more to sustain it—it is
a higher order of being. If the whole
circle of its being were real it would coincide
with its actuality, it would be self-related,
exist for itself, and this would be
the existence of the <i>Idea</i>.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='fss'>III.</span>—<i>The Actual is the Rational.</i></h4>
<p class='c005'>The highest aim is toward perfection;
and this is pursued in the cancelling of
the finite, partial or incomplete, by adding
to it its other or complement—that which
it lacks of the Total or Perfect. Since
this complement is the <i>potential</i>, and since
this potential is and can be the only agent
that acts upon and modifies the real, it
follows that all process is pursuant of the
highest aim; and since the actual is the process
itself, it follows that the actual is the
realization of the Best or of the Rational.
A somewhat has a low order of existence
if the sphere of its reality is small compared
to that of its potentiality. But the
lower its order the more swift and sure
are the potentialities in their work. Hence
no matter how bad anything is, the very
best thing is being wrought upon it. Seize
the moments of the world-history, and
state precisely what they lacked of the
complete realization of spirit, and one will
see clearly that each phase perished by
having just that added to it which it most
of all needed.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='fss'>IV.</span>—“<i>The Form of Eternity.</i>”</h4>
<p class='c005'>To think according to Reason is to think
things under the form of Eternity, says
Spinoza (<i>Res sub quadam specie aeternitatis
percipere</i>). The Form of Eternity is
what we have found as the true actual.
The Phenomenal world is the constant
spectacle wherein each and all is placed
under the form of Eternity. When this is
done, all <i>immediate</i> (or mechanical) being
appears in a state of transition; all <i>mediated</i>
being appears as a merely relative,
i. e. as existing in what lies beyond it; all
<i>absolutely mediated</i> (i. e. self-determined)
being appears in a state of development.
In the first and second stages the individual
loses its identity. In the third stage
the process is one of unfolding, and hence
the continual realizing of a more vivid personal
identity. Thus the Form of Eternity
is to the conscious being the realization of
his Immortality.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>A THOUGHT ON SHAKESPEARE. <br /> <span class='sc'>By Anna C. Brackett.</span></h3>
<p class='c005'>To say that Shakespeare excels others by
virtue of the genius which enables him to
throw himself for the time completely into
each of the characters he represents, is to
say a very common-place thing, and yet it
will bear repeating.</p>

<p class='c006'>His spirit was so many-sided, so universal,
that it was able to take all forms and
perfectly to fit itself to each, so that he always
gives us a consistent character. His
personages are individuals whose every
word agrees with every other they have
spoken, and while the spirit which moves
in them is Shakespeare, he is all, yet no
one of them.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The water unchanged in every case,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doth take on the figure of the vase.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He does not consciously go to work to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>fashion a character, nor does he ask himself
what that character shall say under
the given circumstances, but his soul, being
capable of all, takes on for the time
the form of the character, and then speaks
the things which are most natural to itself
in that form. So entirely is this the case,
that a comparison of the way in which one
of his personages conducts himself under
different circumstances, is sure to amaze
us as we discover the fine touches by which
the unity of the character is preserved.
Goethe’s characters grow—are in a state of
becoming. Shakespeare’s are grown: they
are crystallized. The problem with Goethe
is, the development of a character through
growth; Shakespeare’s: given a certain
character and a certain collision, how
will the given character demean itself?
The common man with an effort could tell
what <i>he himself</i> would have done under
such and such circumstances, but Shakespeare
could have done <i>all things</i>, and
grasping one side of himself he holds it,
and shows it for one person, and another
for another. He never confuses—never
changes. The divine inspiration sways
him. The power to do this, the Universal
which can take on all and be all, is genius.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is not claimed as new in any sense.
I simply wish to illustrate its truth with
regard to the suitors of Portia, by noticing
how perfectly the feelings which each expresses
after the result of his choice is apparent,
are the outcome of the feelings
which decided the choice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The three sets of comments on the caskets
and their mottoes, betray three entirely
different men. Their minds move
differently; they are actuated habitually
by different motives, and the results of the
same failure in Morocco and Arragon are
noticeably different. They are placed in
precisely the same circumstances. They
are both disappointed, but observe how
differently they demean themselves. Morocco
wastes no words. His mood changes
instantly from a doubting hope to despondency
and heartfelt grief, so powerful that
it deprives him of all speech. He goes at
once. But Arragon speaks as if he had
been deceived. First—“How much unlike
art thou to Portia!” That is, I was
led to suppose one thing; I have been misled.
Then—“How much unlike my
hopes!” but, indignation and wounded
pride gaining the ascendency—“<i>and my
deservings!</i>” He re-reads the motto, and
grows more angry still. He has not been
treated fairly, and at last, forgetting himself,
he turns round to Portia with the
fierce, direct question, “Are my deserts no
better?” Portia shows her appreciation
of his state of mind by her evasion, plainly
intimating that he had gone too far in
his manner of addressing her. His very
words are rough and uncourteous in their
abruptness. His question was rude because
so personal. In his haste he has not
even noticed the writing, which now surprises
him, as, feeling her quiet rebuke, he
turns back to the casket to hide his embarrassment,
and he reads. During the reading
he begins to be conscious that he has
been angry without reason, and that he
has not had control enough of himself to
conceal the fact. That he is not a fool is
shown by his consciousness that he has
behaved like one in giving away to his
temper, and as this consciousness begins
to dawn on him, he is ashamed of himself
for having been provoked, and desires to
be gone as soon as possible. He has had a
revelation of himself which is not agreeable,
and he turns to depart, no longer angry
with Portia, but so angry with himself
that he almost forgets to bid the lady
adieu. But suddenly reminded that she is
there, he assumes again his usual, courtly,
outside self, and half in apology for his
anger and rudeness, which might have led
her to suppose that he would forget his
promise, half to recall himself to himself,
he awkwardly ends the scene by assuring
her that he means to keep his word.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, why should Morocco never for one
instant lose his gentlemanly bearing, while
Arragon so wholly forgets himself? Turn
back to the comments before the choice,
and we have the key at once.</p>

<p class='c006'>In their remarks on the leaden chest we
see at first how much more quickly than
Morocco, Arragon rushes at conclusions.
The former becomes at once thoughtful,
and does not pass by even that unattractive
metal without careful pausing. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>reading all three mottoes once, he reads
slowly the inscription on the leaden casket
again, and begins to repeat it a second
time. He feels thoroughly how much depends
on the choice, and is self-distrustful.
Finding that he can gain no suggestion
from the lady, he commends himself for
help to the gods before he proceeds. He
is not the man to be daunted by a threat,
and thinks he detects in that very threat a
false ring. He is conscious of high motives,
but not in vanity, and he decides,
adversely, giving a reason. But Arragon,
before surveying the whole ground, decides
at once about the first he sees, and the
summary way in which he dismisses all
consideration of the leaden casket, savors
strongly of self-esteem. There is a sort
of bravado in the sudden words without a
moment’s pause: “You shall look fairer ere
I give or hazard!” The very use of “shall”
with the second person, forces into view the
will of the speaker. He does not turn to
Portia. He is quite capable of directing his
own actions without help from any god.</p>

<p class='c006'>As Morocco considers the silver, the
principal thing that attracts his attention
is its “virgin hue.” (Remark that Arragon
under the same circumstances calls it a
“treasure house.”) He again begins
thoughtfully to repeat; and again mark
the self-distrust. There is an exquisitely
delicate touch of this in—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If thou be’st rated by thy <i>estimation</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou dost deserve enough.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Relying on the judgment of others, rather
than on his own, but conscious too that
there is good ground for the estimation in
which he knows himself held, the chivalrous
admiration with which he looks up to
the woman he desires, comes in here suddenly
with a doubt whether if all that is
thought of him is deserved, it is enough
to win a pearl of so great price. His conscious
manhood refuses, however, to weaken
itself by doubting, and he again repeats
the clause on which he stopped before. He
goes back to the thought of the estimation
in which he is held; he thinks of his noble
birth, of his princely fortune, of his
graces, and qualities of breeding, and
enumerating all these, he proves his title
to a better nobility by the sudden thought
that the love he bears her is enough to
make him deserve her were she never so
precious, and on that, and that alone, he
rests his claim. But before deciding he
will read again from the gold casket, and
his exclamations on it are only a continuation
of his previous thought. It seems
perfectly plain to him that this must be the
fortunate casket. In his generous love he
forgets himself entirely, and as it were to
show her how wholly he believes in her, he
makes his selection here. Why should he
be angry at the failure? He had no self-assertion
to be wounded. If he deserved
her, it was only because he loved her; and
if he did not deserve her, it was only because
she was more than any one could deserve.</p>

<p class='c006'>As Arragon, after passing by the lead,
turns to the gold, he begins to be a little
more cautious, and repeats like Morocco.
But his mind, instead of turning at once
to Portia as the only prize in the world
wholly desirable, begins from a lofty eminence
of superiority to criticise others
whom he calls the “fool multitude.” He
will not choose what many men desire, because
he prefers to keep out of the ranks.
No democrat, but a proud aristocrat is he,
and so the gold casket is set aside. After
reading from the next, he begins to criticise
again. It seems as if he stood outside
of all the world and coolly reviewed it.
On consideration he is quite sure that there
is no danger of his losing his place even if
“true honor were purchased by the merit
of the wearer,” and basing his choice on
his belief that he deserves success, he orders
peremptorily the opening of the
“treasure house.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Is it not most natural that with such
feelings, such self-complacency, he should
be angry when he finds he has made a mistake?
Nothing can be more galling to a
proud spirit than to discover that the estimation
set upon him by others is lower
than that he sets upon himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not our purpose to compare Bassanio’s
comments with the others. Let us
say only that he evidently prizes sincerity
above all other virtues, and prefers a leaden
casket that is lead all through, to a golden
one that is gold only on the outside,
and so he wins the woman, who, as she
shows us a moment afterwards, is sincere
enough to deserve to be won.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>LEONARDO DA VINCI’S “LAST SUPPER,” <br /> <span class='sc'>As treated by Goethe.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c009'>[The following extracts from Goethe’s treatment of the master-piece of Leonardo da Vinci
were read at a meeting of the St. Louis Art Society, pending the discussion of a fine engraving
of this celebrated picture. The MS. kindly presented to us by the translator we print, in order
to give to those unacquainted with the original an exhibition of Goethe’s thorough manner of
penetrating the spirit of a work of art.—<span class='sc'>Editor.</span>]</p>
<p class='c005'>The Last Supper * * * was
painted upon the wall of the monastery
<i>alle Grazie</i>, at Milan. The place where
the picture is painted must first be considered,
for here the skill of the artist appears
in its most brilliant light. What
could be fitter and nobler for a refectory
than a parting meal, which should be an
object of reverence to the whole world for
all future time. Several years ago, when
travelling, we beheld this dining-room still
undestroyed. Opposite the entrance on
the narrow side, stood the table of the
prior, on both sides of him the tables of
the monks, all of which were raised a step
from the floor—and when the visitor turned
round, he saw painted on the fourth,
above the doors, which are of but moderate
height, a fourth table, and Christ
and his disciples seated at it, as if they
belonged to the society. At meal times it
must have been a telling sight, when the
tables of the prior and Christ looked upon
each other as two opposite pictures, and
the monks at their places found themselves
enclosed between them. And just on this
account the skill of the artist was compelled
to take the existing tables of the
monks as a pattern. Also, the table-cloth,
with its folds still visible with its worked
stripes and tied corners, was taken from
the wash-room of the monastery. The
plates, dishes, cups, and other vessels, are
like those which the monks used.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here was no attempt at imitating an uncertain
antiquated costume; it would have
been highly improper to stretch out the
holy company upon cushions in this place.
No, the picture must be brought near to
the present; Christ must take his last supper
with the Dominicans at Milan. Also,
in many other respects, the painting must
have produced a great effect; the thirteen
figures about ten feet above the floor, one-half
larger than life-size, take up the space
of twenty-eight feet in length. Only two
whole figures can be seen at the opposite
ends of the table, the rest are half-figures;
and here, too, the artist found his advantage
in the necessity of the circumstances.
Every moral expression belongs to the upper
part of the body, and the feet in such
cases are everywhere in the way. The
artist has created here twelve half-figures,
whose laps and knees are covered by the
table and table-cloth, but whose feet are
scarcely visible in the modest twilight beneath.
Let us now imagine ourselves in
the place; let us consider the moral repose
which prevails in such a monastic dining-hall,
and let us admire the artist who has
infused into his picture, powerful emotion,
passionate movement, and at the same time
has kept his work within the bounds of
Nature, and thus brings it in close contrast
with the nearest reality.</p>

<p class='c006'>The means of excitement by which the
artist arouses the quiet holy group, are
the words of the Master: “There is one
among you who shall betray me!” They
are spoken—the whole company falls into
disquiet; but he inclines his head, with
looks cast down; the whole attitude, the
motion of the arms, of the hands, everything
repeats with heavenly submission
the unhappy words: Yes, it is not otherwise,
there is one among you who shall
betray me!</p>

<p class='c006'>Before we go farther, we must point out
a happy device whereby Leonardo principally
enlivened his picture; it is the motion
of the hands; this device, however,
only an Italian could discover. With his
nation, the whole body is full of animation;
every limb participates in the expression
of feeling, of passion, even of
thought. By various motions and forms
of the hand, he expresses: “What do I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>care!—Come hither!—This is a rogue!
beware of him!—He shall not live long!—This
is a main point!—Observe this well,
my hearers!” To such a national peculiarity
Leonardo, who observed every characteristic
point with the closest attention,
must have turned his careful eye. In this
respect, the present picture is unique, and
one can scarcely observe it enough. Every
look and movement perfectly correspond,
and at the same time there is a combined
and contrasted position of the limbs, comprehensible
at a glance, and wrought out in
the most praiseworthy manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>The figures on both sides of the Saviour
may be considered by threes, and each of
these again must be thought into a unity,
placed in relation, and still held in connection
with its neighbors. First, on the
right side of Christ, are John, Judas, and
Peter. Peter the most distant, in consonance
with his violent character, when he
hears the word of the Lord, hastens up behind
Judas, who, looking up affrighted,
bends forward over the table, and holds with
his right hand firmly closed, the purse, but
with the left makes an involuntary nervous
movement, as if he would say: What’s
that? What does that mean? In the
meanwhile Peter has with his left hand
seized the right shoulder of John, who is
inclined towards him, and points to Christ,
and at the same time urges the beloved
disciple to ask who the traitor is. He
strikes a knife-handle, which he holds in
his right hand, inadvertently into the
ribs of Judas, whereby the affrighted
forward movement, which upsets the salt-cellar,
is happily brought out. This group
may be considered as the one which was
first thought out by the artist; it is the
most perfect.</p>

<p class='c006'>If now upon the right hand of the Lord
immediate vengeance is threatened, with a
moderate degree of motion, there arises
upon his left the liveliest horror and detestation
of the treachery. James, the
elder, bends back from fear, extends his
arms, stares with his head bowed down
as one who sees before him the monster
which he has just heard of. Thomas peers
from behind his shoulder, and approaching
the Saviour, raises the index of his right
hand to his forehead. Philip, the third of
this group, rounds it off in the loveliest
manner; he has risen, bends toward the
Master, lays his hands upon his breast, and
declares with the greatest clearness: Lord,
it is not I! Thou knowest it! Thou seest
my pure heart. It is not I!</p>

<p class='c006'>And now, the last three figures of this
group give us new material for thought;
they talk with one another about the terrible
thing which they have just heard.
Matthew, with a zealous motion, turns his
face to the left toward his two companions;
his hands, on the contrary, he stretches
with rapidity towards his master, and thus,
by the most ingenious artifice, unites his
own group with the previous one. Thaddeus
shows the most violent surprise, doubt
and suspicion; he has laid his left hand
open upon the table, and has raised the
right in a manner as if he intended to
strike his left hand with the back of the
right—a movement which one still sees in
men of nature when they wish to express
at an unexpected occurrence: Have I not
said so? Have I not always supposed it?
Simon sits at the end of the table, full of
dignity—we therefore see his whole figure;
he, the eldest of all, is clothed with rich
folds; his countenance and movements
show that he is astonished and reflecting,
not excited, scarcely moved.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we now turn our eyes to the opposite
end of the table, we see Bartholomew, who
stands upon his right foot, with the left
crossed over it; he is supporting his inclined
body by resting both hands firmly
upon the table. He listens, probably to
hear what John will find out from the
Lord; for, in general, the incitement of
the favorite disciple seems to proceed from
this entire side. James, the younger, beside
and behind Bartholomew, lays his left
hand upon Peter’s shoulder, just as Peter
lays his upon the shoulder of John, but
James does so mildly, seeking explanation
only, whereas Peter already threatens vengeance.</p>

<p class='c006'>And thus, as Peter reaches behind Judas,
so James the younger reaches behind Andrew,
who, as one of the most important
figures, shows with his half-raised arms,
his expanded hands in front, a decided expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>of horror, which appears only
once in this picture, while in other works
of less genius, and of less profound
thought, it recurs unfortunately only too
often.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>COPIES GENERALLY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Before we now come to imitations of our
painting, of which the number amounts to
about thirty, we must make some reference
to the subject of copies generally. Such
did not come into use until everybody confessed
that art had reached its culminating
point, whereupon, inferior talents, looking
at the works of the greater masters, despaired
of producing by their own skill anything
similar, either in imitation of nature,
or from the idea; and art, which now
dwindled into mere handicraft, began to
repeat its own creations. This inability
on the part of most of the artists did not
remain a secret to the lovers of art, who,
not being able always to turn to the first
masters, called upon and paid inferior talents,
inasmuch as they preferred, in order
not to receive something altogether destitute
of skill, to order imitations of recognized
works, with a view to being well
served in some degree. This new procedure
was favored, from reasons of illiberality
and overhaste by owners no less than
by artists, and art lowered itself advisedly
by setting out with the purpose to copy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the fifteenth century, as well as in the
previous one, artists entertained a high
idea of themselves and their art, and did
not readily content themselves with repeating
the inventions of others; hence we find
no real copies dating from that period—a
circumstance to which every friend of the
history of art will do well to give heed.
Inferior arts no doubt made use of higher
patterns for smaller works, as in the case
of <i>Niello</i> and other enamelled work, and,
of course, when from religious or other
motives, a repetition was desired, people
contented themselves with an accurate imitation,
which only approximately expressed
the movement and action of the original,
without paying any close regard to
form and color. Hence in the richest galleries
we find no copy previous to the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c006'>But now came the time, when, through
the agency of a few extraordinary men—among
whom our Leonardo must be reckoned
and considered as the first—art in
every one of its parts attained to perfection;
people learned to see and to judge
better, and now the desire for imitations of
first-class work was not difficult to satisfy,
particularly in those schools to which large
numbers of scholars crowded, and in which
the works of the master were greatly in
request. And yet, at that time, this desire
was confined to smaller works which could
be easily compared with the originals and
judged. As regards larger works, the case
was quite different at that time from what
it was at a later period, because the original
cannot be compared with the copies,
and also because such orders are rare.
Thus, then, art, as well as its lovers, contented
itself with copies on a small scale,
and a great deal of liberty was allowed to
the copyist, and the results of this arbitrary
procedure showed themselves, in an
overpowering degree, in the few cases in
which copies on a large scale were desired.
These indeed were generally copies of
copies, and, what is more, generally executed
from copies on a smaller scale, worked
out far away from the original, often from
mere drawings, or even perhaps from memory.
Job-painters now increased by the
dozen, and worked for lower prices; people
made household ornaments of painting;
taste died out; copies increased and darkened
the walls of ante-chambers and stair-cases;
hungry beginners lived on poor pay,
by repeating the most important works on
every scale; yea, many painters passed
the whole of their lives in simply copying;
but even then an amount of deviation appeared
in every copy, either a notion of
the person for whom it was painted, or a
whim of the painter, or perhaps a presumptuous
wish to be original.</p>

<p class='c006'>In addition to this came the demand for
worked tapestry, in which painting was not
content to look dignified, except when
tricked out with gold; and the most magnificent
pictures were considered meagre
and wretched, because they were grave and
simple; therefore the copyist introduced
buildings and landscapes in the background,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>ornaments on the dresses, aureoles
or crowns around the heads, and further,
strangly formed children, animals, chimeras,
grotesques, and other fooleries. It
often happened, also, that an artist, who
believed in his own powers of invention,
received by the will of a client who could
not appreciate his capabilities, a commission
to copy another person’s work, and
since he did so with reluctance, he wished
to appear original here and there, and
therefore made changes or additions as
knowledge, or perhaps vanity, suggested.
Such occurrences took place of course according
to the demands of place and time.
Many figures were used for purposes quite
different from those for which they had
been intended by their first producers.
Secular subjects were, by means of a few
additions, changed into religious ones;
heathen gods and heroes had to submit to
be martyrs and evangelists. Often also,
the artist, for instruction or exercise to
himself, had copied some figure from a celebrated
work, and now he added to it something
of his own invention in order to turn
it into a saleable picture. Finally, we may
certainly ascribe a part of the corruption
of art to the discovery and abuse of copper-plate
engravings, which supplied job-painters
with crowds of foreign inventions,
so that no one any longer studied, and
painting at last reached such a low ebb that
it got mixed up with mechanical works.
In the first place, the copper-plate engravings
themselves were different from the
originals, and whoever copied them multiplied
the changes according to his own or
other peoples’ conviction or whim. The
same thing happened precisely in the case
of drawings; artists took sketches of the
most remarkable subjects in Rome and
Florence, in order to produce arbitrary
repetitions of them when they returned
home.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>COPIES OF THE SUPPER.</h4>
<p class='c005'>In view of the above, we shall be able to
judge what is to be expected, more or less,
of copies of the Supper, although the earliest
were executed contemporaneously;
for the work made a great sensation, and
other monasteries desired similar works.
Of the numerous copies consulted by the
author [Vossi] we shall occupy ourselves
here with only three, since the copies at
Weimar are taken from them; nevertheless,
at the basis of these lies a fourth, of
which, therefore, we must first speak.
<i>Marco d’Oggiono</i>, a pupil of Leonardo da
Vinci’s, though without any extensive talent,
gained the praise of his school chiefly
by his heads, although in them he is not
always equal to himself. About the year
1510, he executed a copy on a small scale,
intending to use it afterwards for a copy
on a larger scale. It was, according to
tradition, not quite accurate; he made it,
however, the basis of a larger copy which
is in the now suppressed monastery at
Castellazzo, likewise in the dining-hall of
the monks of those days. Everything
about it shows careful work; nevertheless
the usual arbitrariness prevails in the details.
And although Vossi has not been
able to say much in its praise, he does not
deny that it is a remarkable monument, and
that the character of several of the heads,
in which the expression is not exaggerated,
is deserving of praise. Vossi has copied
it, and on comparison of the three copies
we shall be able to pronounce judgment
upon it from our own observation.</p>

<p class='c006'>A second copy, of which we likewise
have the heads copied before us, is found
in fresco on the wall at Ponte Capriasca;
it is referred to the year 1565, and ascribed
to Pierro Lovino. Its merits we shall learn
in the sequel; it has the peculiarity that
the names of the figures are written underneath,
a piece of foresight which aids us
in arriving at a correct characterization of
the different physiognomies.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gradual destruction of the original
we have described in sufficient detail, and
it was already in a very wretched condition
when, in 1612, Cardinal Frederico
Borromeo, a zealous friend of art, endeavored
to prevent the entire loss of the work,
and commissioned a Milanese, Andrea
Bianchi, surnamed Vespino, to execute a
full-sized copy. This artist first tried his
skill on a few of the heads; being successful
in these, he proceeded and copied the
whole of the figures, separately however,
and afterwards put them together with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>greatest possible care; the picture is at
present to be found in the Ambrosiana library
at Milan, and lies mainly at the basis
of the most recent copy, executed by Vossi.
This was executed on the following occasion.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>LATEST COPY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>The Kingdom of Italy was decreed, and
Prince Eugène, following the example of
Luigi Sforza, wished to glorify the beginning
of his reign by patronizing the fine
arts. Luigi had ordered a representation
of the Last Supper of Leonardo; Eugène
resolved to restore, as far as possible, the
painting that had been going to wreck for
three hundred years in a new picture,
which, in order that it might be indestructible,
was to be done in mosaic, for which
preparation had been made in an already
existing institution.</p>

<p class='c006'>Vossi immediately receives the commission,
and commences in the beginning of
May, 1807. He finds it advisable to execute
a full-sized cartoon, takes up anew the
studies of his youth, and applies himself entirely
to Leonardo, studies his art-remains
and his writings, particularly the latter,
because he is persuaded that a man who
has produced such splendid works must
have worked on the most decided and advantageous
principles. He had made drawings
of the heads in the copy at Ponte Capriasca,
as well as of some other parts of
it, likewise of the heads and hands of the
Castellazzo copy, and of that of Bianchi.
Then he makes drawings of everything
coming from Da Vinci himself, and even
of what comes from some of his contemporaries.
Moreover he looks about for all
the extant copies, and succeeds in making
more or less acquaintance with twenty-seven;
drawings and manuscripts of Da
Vinci’s are kindly sent to him from all quarters.
In the working out of his cartoon,
he adheres principally to the Ambrosiana
copy; it alone is as large as the original.
Bianchi, by means of thread-nets and
transparent paper, had endeavored to give
a most accurate copy of the original,
which, although already very much injured,
was not yet painted over.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the end of October, 1807, the cartoon
is ready; canvass grounded uniformly in
one piece, and the whole immediately
sketched out. Hereupon, in order in some
measure to regulate his tints, Vossi painted
the small portion of sky and landscape,
which, on account of the depth and purity
of the colors in the original, had still remained
fresh and brilliant. Hereupon he
paints the head of Christ and those of the
three apostles at his left, and as for the
dresses, he first paints those about whose
colors he had first arrived at certainly, with
a view to selecting the rest according to the
principles of the master and his own taste.
Thus he covered the whole of the canvass,
guided by careful reflection, and kept his
colors of uniform height and strength.</p>

<p class='c006'>Unfortunately, in this damp, deserted
place, he was seized with an illness which
compelled him to put a stop to his exertions;
nevertheless, he employed this interval
in arranging drawings, copper-plate
engravings, partly with a view to the Supper
itself, partly to other works of the master;
at the same time he was favored by
fortune, which brought him a collection of
drawings, purporting to come from Cardinal
Cæsar Monti, and containing, among
other treasures, remarkable productions of
Leonardo himself. He studied even the
authors contemporaneous with Leonardo,
in order to make use of their opinions and
wishes, and looked about him for everything
that could further his design. Thus
he took advantage of his sickness, and at
last attained strength to set about his work
anew.</p>

<p class='c006'>No artist or friend of art will leave unread
the account of how he managed the
details, how he thought out the characters
of the faces and their expression, and even
the motions of the hands, and how he represented
them. In the same manner he
thinks out the dishes, the room, the back-ground,
and shows that he has not decided
upon any part without the strongest reasons.
What care he takes about representing
the feet under the table in correct attitudes,
because this portion of the original
had long been destroyed, and in the copies
had been carelessly treated!</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c006'>Of the relation of the two copies—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>merits of the third can be shown only to
the eye, not to the mind in words—we shall
state in a few words the most essential
and most decided points, until we shall be
fortunate enough, as we shall perhaps one
day be, to be able to lay copies of these interesting
sheets before the friends of art.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>COMPARISON.</h4>
<p class='c005'><i>St. Bartholomew</i>, manly youth, sharp
profile, compressed, clear face, eyelid and
brow pressed down, mouth closed, as if
listening with suspicion, a character completely
circumscribed within itself. In Vespino’s
copy no trace of individual characteristic
features, a general kind of drawing-book
face, listening with open mouth. Vossi
has approved of this opening of the lips,
and retained it, a procedure to which we
should be unable to lend our assent.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>St. James</i> the younger, likewise profile,
relationship to Christ unmistakable, receives
from the protruded, slightly opened
lips, something individual, which again
cancels this similarity. According to Vespino,
almost an ordinary, academical Christ,
the mouth opened rather in astonishment
than in inquiry. Our assertion that Bartholomew
must have his mouth closed, receives
support from the fact that his neighbor
has his mouth open. Such a repetition
Leonardo would never have endured; on
the contrary, the next figure,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>St. Andrew</i> has his mouth shut. Like
persons advanced in life, he presses the
lower lip rather against the upper. In the
copy of Marco, this head has something
peculiar, not to be expressed in words;
the eyes are introverted; the mouth,
though shut, is still <i>naïve</i>. The outline of
the left side against the back ground forms
a beautiful silhouette; enough of the other
side of the forehead (eye, nose and beard)
is seen to give the head a roundness and
a peculiar life; on the contrary, Vespino
suppresses the left eye altogether, but
shows so much of the left temple and of
the side of the beard as to produce in the
uplifted face a full bold expression, which
is indeed striking, but which would seem
more suitable to clenched fists than to
open hands stretched forward.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Judas</i> locked up within himself, frightened,
looking anxiously up and back, profile
strongly dented, not exaggerated, by
no means an ugly formation; for good
taste would not tolerate any real monster
in the proximity of pure and upright men.
Vespino, on the other hand, has actually
represented such a monster, and it cannot
be denied that, regarded by itself, this
head has much merit; it expresses vividly
a mischievously bold malignity, and would
make itself eminently conspicuous in a
mob triumphing over an <i>Ecce Homo</i>, and
crying out “Crucify! crucify!” It might
be made to pass for Mephistopheles in his
most devilish moment. But of affright or
dread, combined with dissimulation, indifference
and contempt, there is not a
trace; the bristly hair fits in with the <i>tout
ensemble</i> admirably; its exaggeration, however,
is matched only by the force and violence
of the rest of Vespino’s heads.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>St. Peter.</i>—Very problematical features.
Even in Marco, it is merely an expression
of pain; of wrath or menace there is no
sign; there is also a certain anxiety expressed,
and here Leonardo may not have
been at one even with himself; for cordial
sympathy with a beloved master, and
threatening against a traitor, are with difficulty
united in one countenance. Nevertheless,
Cardinal Borromeo asserts that
he saw such a miracle in his time. However
pleasant it might be to believe this,
we have reason to suppose that the art-loving
cardinal expressed his own feeling
rather than what was in the picture;
for otherwise we should be unable to defend
our friend Vespino, whose Peter has
an unpleasant expression. He looks like a
stern Capuchin monk, whose Lent sermon
is intended to rouse sinners. It is strange
that Vespino has given him bushy hair,
since the Peter of Marco shows a beautiful
head of short, curled tresses.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>St. John</i> is represented by Marco in the
spirit of Da Vinci; the beautiful roundish
face, somewhat inclined to oval, the hair
smooth towards the top of the head, but
curling gently downwards, particularly
where it bends round Peter’s inserted
hand, are most lovely; what we see of the
dark of the eye is turned away from Peter—a
marvellously fine piece of observation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>in that while he is listening with the intensest
feeling to the secret speech of his
neighbor, he turns away his eyes from him.
According to Vespino, he is a comfortable-looking,
quiet, almost sleepy youth, without
any trace of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c006'>We turn now to the left side of Christ,
in order that the figure of the Saviour may
come last in our description.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>St. Thomas’</i> head and right hand, whose
upraised fore-finger is bent slightly toward
his brow to imply reflection. This movement,
which is so much in keeping with a
person who is suspicious or in doubt, has
been hitherto misunderstood, and a hesitating
disciple looked upon as threatening.
In Vespino’s copy, likewise, he is reflective
enough, but as the artist has again left
out the retreating right eye, the result is a
perpendicular, monotonous profile, without
any remnant of the protruding, searching
elements of the older copies.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>St. James</i> the Elder.—The most violent
agitation of the features, the most gaping
mouth, horror in his eye; an original venture
of Leonardo’s; yet we have reason to
believe that this head, likewise, has been
remarkably succesful with Marco. The
working out is magnificent, whereas in the
copy of Vespino all is lost; attitude, manner,
mien, everything has vanished, and
dwindles down into a sort of indifferent
generality.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>St. Philip</i>, amiable and invaluable, resembles
Raffaelle’s youths, collected on the
left side of <i>The School of Athens</i> about
Bramante. Vespino has, unfortunately,
again suppressed the right eye, and as he
could not deny that there was something
more than profile in the thing, he has produced
an ambiguous, strangely inclined
head.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>St. Matthew</i>, young, of undesigning
nature, with curly hair, an anxious expression
in the slightly opened mouth,
in which the teeth, which are visible, express
a sort of slight ferocity in keeping
with the violent movement of the figure.
Of all this nothing remains in Vespino; he
gazes before him, stiff and expressionless;
one does not receive the remotest notion
of the violent movement of the body.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>St. Thaddeus</i>, according to Marco, is
likewise quite an invaluable head; anxiety,
suspicion, vexation, are expressed in
every feature. The unity of this agitation
of the countenance is extremely fine, and
is entirely in keeping with the movement
of the hands which we have already explained.
In Vespino, everything is again
reduced to a general level; he has also
made the head still more unmeaning by
turning it too much towards the spectator,
whereas, according to Marco, hardly a
quarter of the left side is seen, whereby
the suspicious, askance-looking element is
admirably portrayed.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>St. Simon</i> the Elder, wholly in profile,
placed opposite the likewise pure profile of
young Matthew. In him the protruding
under lip which Leonardo had such a partiality
for in old faces, is most exaggerated;
but, along with the grave, overhanging
brow, produces the most wonderful
effect of vexation and reflection, in sharp
contrast with the passionate movement of
young Matthew. In Vespino he is a good-natured
old man in his dotage, incapable
of taking any interest in even the most
important occurrence that might take place
in his presence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having thus now thrown light upon the
apostles, we turn to the form of <i>Christ</i>
himself. And here again we are met by
the legend, that Leonardo was unable to
finish either Christ or Judas, which we
readily believe, since, from his method, it
was impossible for him to put the last
touch to those two extremes of portraiture.
Wretched enough, in the original, after all
the darkening processes it had to undergo,
may have been the appearance presented
by the features of Christ, which were only
sketched. How little Vespino found remaining,
may be gleaned from the fact
that he brought out a colossal head of
Christ, quite at variance with the purpose of
Da Vinci, without paying the least attention
to the inclination of the head, which
ought of necessity to have been made parallel
with the inclination of John’s. Of
the expression we shall say nothing; the
features are regular, good-natured, intelligent,
like those we are accustomed to see
in Christ, but without the very smallest
particle of sensibility, so that we should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>almost be unable to tell what New Testament
story this head would be welcome
to.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are here met and aided by the circumstance
that connoisseurs assert, that
Leonardo himself painted the head of the
Saviour at Castellazzo, and ventured to do
in another’s work what he had not been
willing to undertake in his own principal
figure. As we have not the original before
us, we must say of the copy that it agrees
entirely with the conception which we form
of a noble man whose breast is weighed
down by poignant suffering of soul, which
he has endeavored to alleviate by a familiar
word, but has thereby only made matters
worse instead of better.</p>

<p class='c006'>By these processes of comparison, then,
we have come sufficiently near the method
of this extraordinary artist, such as he has
clearly explained and demonstrated it in
writings and pictures, and fortunately it is
in our power to take a step still further in
advance. There is, namely, preserved in
the Ambrosiana library a drawing incontestably
executed by Leonardo, upon bluish
paper, with a little white and colored chalk.
Of this the chevalier Vossi has executed
the most accurate <i>fac-simile</i>, which is also
before us. A noble youthful face, drawn
from nature, evidently with a view to the
head of Christ at the Supper. Pure, regular
features, smooth hair, the head bent to
the left side, the eyes cast down, the mouth
half opened, the <i>tout ensemble</i> brought
into the most marvellous harmony by a
slight touch of sorrow. Here indeed we
have only the man who does not conceal a
suffering of soul, but the problem, how,
without extinguishing this promise, at the
same time to express sublimity, independence,
power, the might of godhead, is one
which even the most gifted earthly pencil
might well find hard to solve. In this
youthful physiognomy which hovers between
Christ and John, we see the highest
attempt to hold fast by nature when the
supermundane is in question.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>PAUL JANET AND HEGEL.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a></h3>
<p class='c009'>[In the following article the passages quoted are turned into English, and the original
French is omitted for the sake of brevity and lucid arrangement. As the work reviewed is
accessible to most readers, a reference to the pages from which we quote will answer all
purposes.—<span class='sc'>Editor.</span>]</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the death of Hegel in 1831, his
philosophy has been making a slow but
regular progress into the world at large.
At home in Germany it is spoken of as
having a right wing, a left wing, and a
centre; its disciples are very numerous
when one counts such widely different philosophers
as Rosenkrantz, Michelet, Kuno
Fischer, Erdmann, J. H. Fichte, Strauss,
Feuerbach, and their numerous followers.
Sometimes when one hears who constitute
a “wing” of the Hegelian school, he is
reminded of the “<i>lucus a non</i>” principle
of naming, or rather of misnaming things.
But Hegelianism has, as we said, made its
way into other countries. In France we
have the Æsthetics “partly translated and
partly analyzed,” by Professor Bénard;
the logic of the small Encyclopædia, translated
with copious notes, by Professor Vera,
who has gone bravely on, with what seems
with him to be a work of love, and given
us the “Philosophy of Nature” and the
“Philosophy of Spirit,” and promises us
the “Philosophy of Religion”—all accompanied
with abundant introduction and
commentary. We hear of others very
much influenced by Hegel: M. Taine, for
example, who writes brilliant essays. In
English, too, we have a translation of the
“Philosophy of History,” (in Bohn’s Library;)
a kind of translation and analysis
of the first part of the third volume of the
Logic, (Sloman &amp; Wallon, London, 1855);
and an extensive and elaborate work on
“The Secret of Hegel,” by James Hutchison
Stirling. We must not forget to
mention a translation of Schwegler’s History
of Philosophy—a work drawn principally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>from Hegel’s labors—by our American
Professor Seelye: and also (just published)
a translation of the same book by
the author of the “Secret of Hegel.”
Articles treating of Hegel are to be found
by the score—seek them in every text-book
on philosophy, in every general Cyclopædia,
and in numerous works written for
or against German Philosophy. Some of
these writers tell us in one breath that
Hegel was a man of prodigious genius, and
in the next they convict him of confounding
the plainest of all common sense distinctions.
Some of them find him the profoundest
of all thinkers, while others cannot
“make a word of sense out of him.”
There seems to be a general understanding
in this country and England on one point:
all agree that he was a Pantheist. Theodore
Parker, Sir William Hamilton, Mansell,
Morell, and even some of the English
defenders of Hegelianism admit this. Hegel
holds, say some, that God is a <i>becoming</i>;
others say that he holds God to be
<i>pure being</i>. These men are careful men
apparently—but only <i>apparently</i>, for it
must be confessed that if Hegel has written
any books at all, they are, every one of
them, devoted to the task of showing the
inadequacy of such abstractions when
made the highest principle of things.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ripest product of the great German
movement in philosophy, which took
place at the beginning of this century, Hegel’s
philosophy is likewise the concretest
system of thought the world has seen.
This is coming to be the conviction of
thinkers more and more every day as they
get glimpses into particular provinces of
his labor. Bénard thinks the Philosophy
of Art the most wonderful product of modern
thinking, and speaks of the Logic—which
he does not understand—as a futile
and perishable production. Another thinks
that his Philosophy of History is immortal,
and a third values extravagantly his Philosophy
of Religion. But the one who
values his Logic knows how to value all
his labors. The History of Philosophy is
the work that impresses us most with the
unparalleled wealth of his thought; he is
able to descend through all history, and
give to each philosopher a splendid thought
as the centre of his system, and yet never
is obliged to confound different systems,
or fail in showing the superior depth of
modern thought. While we are admiring
the depth and clearness of Pythagoras, we
are surprised and delighted to find the
great thought of Heraclitus, but Anaxagoras
is a new surprise; the Sophists
come before us bearing a world-historical
significance, and Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle
lead us successively to heights such
as we had not dreamed attainable by any
thinking.</p>

<p class='c006'>But thought is no <i>immediate</i> function,
like the process of breathing or sleeping,
or fancy-making: it is the profoundest
mediation of spirit, and he who would get
an insight into the speculative thinkers of
whatever time, must labor as no mere
flesh and blood can labor, but only as
spirit can labor: with agony and sweat of
blood. A philosophy which should explain
the great complex of the universe, could
hardly be expected to be transparent to uncultured
minds at the first glance. Thus it
happens that many critics give us such
discouraging reports upon their return
from a short excursion into the true wonder-land
of philosophy. The Eternal Verities
are miraculous only to those eyes
which have gazed long upon them after
shutting out the glaring sunlight of the
senses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those who criticise a philosophy must
imply a philosophical method of their own,
and thus measure themselves while they
measure others. A literary man who criticises
Goethe, or Shakespeare, or Homer,
is very apt to lay himself bare to the shaft
of the adversary. There are, however, in
our time, a legion of writers who pass
judgment as flippantly upon a system of
the most comprehensive scope—and which
they confess openly their inability to understand—as
upon a mere opinion uttered
in a “table-talk.” Even some men of
great reputation give currency to great
errors. Sir William Hamilton, in his notes
to Reid’s Philosophy of “Touch,” once
quoted the passage from the second part
of Fichte’s <i>Bestimmung des Menschen</i>,
(wherein onesided idealism is pushed to
its downfall,) in order to show that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Fichte’s Philosophy ended in Nihilism.
The <i>Bestimmung des Menschen</i> was a mere
popular writing in which Fichte adopted
the Kantian style of exhibiting the self-refutation
of sense and reflection, in order
to rest all ultimate truth in the postulates
of the Practical Reason. Accordingly he
shows the practical results of his own system
in the third part of the work in question,
and enforces the soundest ethical
views of life. He never thought of presenting
his theoretical philosophy in that
work. Thus, too, in Hamilton’s refutation
of Cousin and Schelling: he polemicises
against all “Doctrines of the Absolute,”
saying that <i>to think is to limit; hence to
think God would be to determine or limit
Him</i>; and hence is inferred the impossibility
of thinking God as he truly is. This,
of course, is not pushed to its results by
his followers, for then its skeptical tendency
would become obvious. Religion
demands that we shall do the Will of God;
this Will must, therefore, be known. But,
again, Will is the realization or self-determination
of one’s nature—from it the character
proceeds. Thus in knowing God’s
will we know his character or nature. If
we cannot do this at all, no religion is possible;
and in proportion as Religion is
possible, the Knowledge of God is possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be said that the Absolute is unthinkable,
in this assertion it is affirmed
that all predicates or categories of thought
are inapplicable to the Absolute, for to
think is to predicate of some object, the
categories of thought; and in so far as
these categories apply, to that extent is
the Absolute thinkable. Since <i>Existence</i>
is a category of thought, it follows from
this position that to predicate existence of
the Absolute is impossible; “a questionable
predicament” truly for the Absolute.
According to this doctrine—that all thought
is limitation—God is made Pure Being, or
Pure Thought. This is also the result of
Indian Pantheism, and of all Pantheism;
this doctrine concerning the mere negative
character of thought, in fact, underlies
the Oriental tenet that consciousness is
finitude. To be consistent, all Hamiltonians
should become Brahmins, or, at least,
join some sect of modern Spiritualists, and
thus embrace a religion that corresponds
to their dogma. However, let us not be so
unreasonable as to insist upon the removal
of inconsistency—it is all the good they
have.</p>

<p class='c006'>After all this preliminary let us proceed
at once to examine the work of Professor
Paul Janet, which we have named at the
head of our article: “<i>Essai sur la dialectique
dans Platon et dans Hegel</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>After considering the Dialectic of Plato
in its various aspects, and finding that it
rests on the principle of contradiction, M.
Janet grapples Hegel, and makes, in order,
the following points:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. <span class='sc'>Terminology.</span>—He tells us that the
great difficulty that lies in the way of comprehending
German Philosophy is the abstract
terminology employed, which is, in
fact, mere scholasticism preserved and applied
to modern problems. No nation of
modern times, except the Germans, have
preserved the scholastic form. He traces
the obscurity of modern German philosophy
to “Aristotle subtilized by the
schools.” This he contrasts with the
“simple and natural philosophy of the
Scotch.” [This “simplicity” arises from
the fact that the Scotch system holds that
immediate sensuous knowing is valid. Of
course this implies that they hold that the
immediate existence of objects is a true
existence—that whatever is, exists thus
and so without any further grounds. This
is the denial of all philosophy, for it
utterly ignores any occasion whatever for
it. But it is no less antagonistic to the
“natural science” of the physicist: he,
the physicist, finds the immediate object of
the senses to be no permanent or true
phase, but only a transitory one; the object
is involved with other beings—even
the remotest star—and changes when they
change. It is force and matter (two very
abstract categories) that are to him the
permanent and true existence. But force
and matter cannot be seen by the senses;
they can only be thought.] Our author
proceeds to trace the resemblance between
Hegel and Wolff: both consider and analyze
the pure concepts, beginning with
Being. To M. Janet this resemblance
goes for much, but he admits that “Hegel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>has modified this order (that of Wolff) and
rendered it more systematic.” If one
asks “<i>How</i> more systematic?” he will not
find the answer. “The scholastic <i>form</i> is
retained, but not the <i>thought</i>,” we are
told. That such statements are put forward,
even in a book designed for mere
surface-readers may well surprise us.
That the mathematical method of Wolff or
Spinoza—a method which proceeds by
definitions and external comparison, holding
meanwhile to the principle of contradiction—that
such a method should be
confounded with that of Hegel which proceeds
dialectically, i. e. through the internal
movement of the categories to their
contradiction or limit, shows the student
of philosophy at once that we are
dealing with a <i>littérateur</i>, and not with a
philosopher. So far from retaining the
form of Wolff it is the great object of Hegel
(see his long prefaces to the “Logik”
and the “Phänomenologie des Geistes”)
to supplant that form by what he considers
the true method—that of the <i>objective</i>
itself. The objective method is
to be distinguished from the arbitrary
method of external reflection which selects
its point of view somewhere outside of the
object considered, and proceeds to draw
relations and comparisons which, however
edifying, do not give us any exhaustive
knowledge. It is also to be distinguished
from the method of mere empirical observation
which collects without discrimination
a mass of characteristics, accidental
and necessary, and never arrives at
a vivifying soul that unites and subordinates
the multiplicity. The objective
method seizes somewhat in its definition
and traces it through all the phases which
necessarily unfold when the object is
placed in the form of <i>relation to itself</i>.
An object which cannot survive the process
of self-relation, perishes, i. e. it leads
to a more concrete object which is better
able to endure. This method, as we shall
presently see, is attributed to Plato by M.
Janet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only resemblance that remains to be
noted between the scholastics and Hegel is
this: they both treat of subtle distinctions
in thought, while our modern “common
sense” system goes only so far as to distinguish
very general and obvious differences.
This is a questionable merit, and
the less ado made about it by such as take
pride in it, the better for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our author continues: “The principal
difficulty of the system of Kant is our
ignorance of the ancient systems of logic.
The Critique of Pure Reason is modelled
on the scholastic system.” Could we have
a more conclusive refutation of this than
the fact that the great professors of the
ancient systems grossly misunderstand
Kant, and even our essayist himself mistakes
the whole purport of the same!
Hear him contrast Kant with Hegel: “Kant
sees in Being only the form of Thought,
while Hegel sees in Thought only the form
of Being.” This he says is the great difference
between the Germans and French,
interpreting it to mean: “that the former
pursues the route of deduction, and the
latter that of experience”!</p>

<p class='c006'>He wishes to consider Hegel under three
heads: 1st, The Beginning; 2d, the dialectical
deduction of the Becoming, and
3d, the term Dialectic.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. <span class='sc'>The Beginning.</span>—According to M.
Janet, Hegel must have used this syllogism
in order to find the proper category with
which to commence the Logic.</p>

<p class='c006'>(a) The Beginning should presuppose
nothing;</p>

<p class='c006'>(b) Pure Being presupposes nothing;</p>

<p class='c006'>(c) Hence Pure Being is the Beginning.</p>

<p class='c006'>This syllogism he shows to be inconclusive:
for there are two beginnings, (a) in
the order of knowledge, (b) in the order of
existence. Are they the same? He answers:
“No, the thinking being—because
it thinks—knows itself before it knows the
being which it thinks.” Subject and object
being identical in that act, M. Janet
in effect says, “it thinks itself before it
thinks itself”—an argument that the scholastics
would hardly have been guilty of!
The beginning is really made, he says, with
internal or external <i>experience</i>. He quotes
(page 316) from Hegel a passage asserting
that <i>mediation</i> is essential to knowing.
This he construes to mean that “the determined
or concrete (the world of experience)
is the essential condition of knowing!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Through his misapprehension of
the term “mediation,” we are prepared
for all the errors that follow, for “mediation
in knowing” means with Hegel that
it involves a <i>process</i>, and hence can be true
only in the form of a system. The “internal
and external experience” appertains
to what Hegel calls immediate knowing.
It is therefore not to be wondered at that
M. Janet thinks Hegel contradicts himself
by holding Pure Being to be the Beginning,
and afterwards affirming mediation
to be necessary. He says (page 317),
“In the order of knowing it is the mediate
which is necessarily first, while in the
order of existence the immediate is the
commencement.” Such a remark shows
him to be still laboring on the first problem
of Philosophy, and without any light, for
no <i>Speculative</i> Philosopher (like Plato,
Aristotle, Leibnitz, or Hegel) ever held
that Pure Being—or the immediate—is
the first in the order of existence, but
rather that God or Spirit (self-thinking,
“pure act,” Νοῦς, “Logos,” &amp;c.) is the
first in the order of existence. In fact,
M. Janet praises Plato and Aristotle for
this very thing at the end of his volume,
and thereby exhibits the unconsciousness
of his procedure. Again, “The pure
thought is the end of philosophy, and not
its beginning.” If he means by this that
the culture of consciousness ends in arriving
at pure thought or philosophy, we
have no objection to offer, except to the
limiting of the application of the term
Philosophy to its preliminary stage, which
is called the Phenomenology of Spirit.
The arrival at pure thought marks the beginning
of the use of terms in a universal
sense, and hence is the beginning of philosophy
proper. But M. Janet criticises
the distinction made by Hegel between
Phenomenology and Psychology, and instances
Maine de Biran as one who writes
Psychology in the sense Hegel would write
Phenomenology. But M. Biran merely
manipulates certain unexplained phenomena,—like
the Will, for example—in order
to derive categories like force, cause, &amp;c.
But Hegel shows in his Phenomenology the
dialectical unfolding of consciousness
through all its phases, starting from the
immediate certitude of the senses. He
shows how certitude becomes knowledge of
truth, and wherein it differs from it. But
M. Janet (p. 324) thinks that Hegel’s system,
beginning in empirical Psychology, climbs
to pure thought, “and then draws up the
ladder after it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>III. <span class='sc'>The Becoming.</span>—We are told by the
author that consciousness determining itself
as Being, determines itself as <i>a</i> being,
and not as <i>the</i> being. If this be so we
cannot think <i>pure being</i> at all. Such an
assertion amounts to denying the universal
character of the Ego. If the position stated
were true, we could think neither being
nor any other object.</p>

<p class='c006'>On page 332, he says, “This contradiction
(of Being and non-being) which in
the ordinary logic would be the negative
of the <i>posited notion</i>, is, in the logic of
Hegel, only an excitant or stimulus, which
somehow determines spirit to find a third
somewhat in which it finds the other conciliated.”
He is not able to see any procedure
at all. He sees the two opposites,
and thinks that Hegel empirically hunts
out a concept which implies both, and substitutes
it for them. M. Janet thinks (pp.
336-7) that Hegel has exaggerated the difficulties
of conceiving the identity of Being
and nought. (p. 338) “If the difference
of Being and nought can be neither
expressed nor defined, if they are as identical
as different—if, in short, the idea of
Being is only the idea of the pure void, I will
say, not merely that Being transforms itself
into Nothing, or passes into its contrary;
I will say that there are not two
contraries, but only one term which I have
falsely called Being in the thesis, but
which is in reality only Non-being without
restriction—the pure zero.” He quotes
from Kuno Fischer (p. 340) the following
remarks applicable here:</p>

<p class='c016'>“If Being were in reality the pure void as
it is ordinarily taken, Non-being would not express
the same void a second time; but it
would then be the non-void, i. e. the abhorrence
of the void, or the immanent contradiction
of the void.”—(and again from his “Logik
und Metaphysik” II. § 29): “The logical Being
contradicts itself; for thought vanishes in
the immovable repose of Being. But as Being
comes only from thought (for it is the act of
thought), it contradicts thus itself in destroying
thought. Consequently thought manifests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>itself as the negation of Being—that is to say,
as <i>Non-being</i>. The Non-being (logical) is not
the total suppression of Being—the pure zero—it
is not the mathematical opposition of Being
to itself as a negative opposed to a positive,
but it is the dialectical negative of itself,
the immanent contradiction of Being. Being
contradicts itself, hence is Non-being, and in
the concept of Non-being, thought discovers
the immanent contradiction of Being—thought
manifests itself at first as Being, and in turn
the logical Being manifests itself as Non-being;
thought can hence say, “I am the Being which
is not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Such,” continues our author, “is the
deduction of M. Fischer. It seems to me
very much inferior in clearness to that
of Hegel.” How he could say this is
very mysterious when we find him denying
all validity to Hegel’s demonstration. Although
Fischer’s explanation is mixed—partly
dialectical and partly psychological—yet,
as an explanation, it is correct.
But as psychology should not be dragged
into Logic, which is the evolution of the
forms of pure thinking, we must hold
strictly to the dialectic if we would see the
“Becoming.” The psychological explanation
gets no further than the relation of
Being and nought as concepts. The Hegelian
thought on this point is not widely
different from that of Gorgias, as given us
by Sextus Empiricus, nor from that of Plato
in the Sophist. Let us attempt it here:</p>

<p class='c006'>Being is the pure simple; as such it is
considered under the form of self-relation.
But as it is wholly undetermined, and has
no content, it is pure nought or absolute
negation. As such it is the negation by
itself or the negation of itself, and hence
its own opposite or Being. Thus the simple
falls through self-opposition into duality,
and this again becomes simple if we
attempt to hold it asunder, or give it any
validity by itself. Thus if Being is posited
as having validity in and by itself without
determination, (<i>omnis determinatio est negatio</i>),
it becomes a pure void in nowise
different from nought, for difference is determination,
and neither Being nor nought
possess it. What is the validity of the
nought? A negative is a relative, and a
negative by itself is a negative related to
itself, which is a self-cancelling. Thus
Being and nought, posited objectively as
having validity, prove dissolving forms and
pass over into each other. Being is a <i>ceasing</i>
and nought is a <i>beginning</i>, and these
are the two forms of <i>Becoming</i>. The Becoming,
dialectically considered, proves
itself inadequate likewise.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. <span class='sc'>The Dialectic.</span>—To consider an
object dialectically we have merely to give
it universal validity; if it contradicts itself
then, <i>we</i> are not in anywise concerned for
the result; we will simply stand by and accept
the result, without fear that the true
will not appear in the end. The negative
turned against itself makes short work of
itself; it is only when the subjective reflection
tries to save it by hypotheses and reservations
that a merely negative result is
obtained.</p>

<p class='c006'>(Page 369): “In Spinozism the development
of Being is Geometric; in the System
of Hegel it is organic.” What could
have tempted him to use these words, it is
impossible to say, unless it was the deep-seated
national proclivity for epigrammatic
statements. This distinction means nothing
less (in the mouth of its original author)
than what we have already given as
the true difference between Wolff’s and
Hegel’s methods; but M. Janet has long
since forgotten his earlier statements.
(Page 369) He says, “Hegel’s method is a
faithful expression of the movement of
nature,” from which he thinks Hegel derived
it empirically!</p>

<p class='c006'>On page 372 he asks: “Who proves to
us that the dialectic stops at <i>Spirit</i> as its
last term? Why can I not conceive a spirit
absolutely superior to mine, in whom the
identity between subject and object, the
intelligible and intelligence would be more
perfect than it is with this great Philosopher
[Hegel]? ***** In fact, every
philosopher is a man, and so far forth is
full of obscurity and feebleness.” Spirit
is the last term in philosophy for the reason
that it stands in complete self-relation,
and hence contains its antithesis within
itself; if it could stand in opposition to
anything else, then it would contain a contradiction,
and be capable of transition
into a higher. M. Janet asks in effect:
“Who proves that the dialectic stops at
God as the highest, and why cannot I conceive
a higher?” Judging from his attempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>at understanding Hegel, however, he is not
in a fair way to conceive “a spirit in whom
the identity between subject and object”
is more perfect than in Hegel. “What
hinders” is his own culture, his own self;
“<i>Du gleichst dem Geist den du begreifst,
nicht mir</i>,” said the World-spirit to Faust.</p>

<p class='c006'>He asks, (p. 374): “When did the ‘pure
act’ commence?” From Eternity; it always
commences, and is always complete,
says Hegel. “According to Hegel, God
is made from nought, by means of the
World.” Instead of this, Hegel holds that
God is self-created, and the world eternally
created by him (the Eternally-begotten
Son). “What need has God of Nature?”
God is Spirit; hence conscious;
hence he makes himself an object to himself;
in this act he creates nature; hence
Nature is His reflection. (P. 386): “The
Absolute in Hegel is spirit only on condition
that it thinks, and thinks <i>itself</i>;
hence it is not <i>essentially</i> Spirit, but only
<i>accidentally</i>.” To “<i>think itself</i>” is to be
conscious, and, without this, God would
have no personality; and hence if Hegel
were to hold any other doctrine than the
one attributed to him, he would be a Pantheist.
But these things are not mere
dogmas with Hegel; they appear as the
logical results of the most logical of systems.
“But in Plato, God is a Reason <i>in
activity</i>, a living thought.” M. Janet mentions
this to show Plato’s superiority; he
thinks that it is absurd for Hegel to attribute
<i>thinking</i> to God, but thinks the same
thing to be a great merit in Plato. (P.
392): “Behold the Platonic deduction
[or dialectic]: being given a pure idea, he
shows that this idea, if it were <i>all alone</i>,
[i. e. made universal, or placed in self-relation,
or posited as valid for itself,]
would be contradictory of itself, and consequently
could not be. Hence, if it exists,
it is on condition that it mingles with
another idea. Take, for example, the
multiple: by itself, it loses itself in the
indiscernible, for it would be impossible
without unity.” This would do very well
for a description of the Dialectic in Hegel
if he would lay more stress on the positive
side of the result. Not merely does the
“pure idea mingle with another”—i. e.
pass over to its opposite—but it <i>returns</i>
into itself by the continuation of its own
movement, and thereby reaches a concrete
stage. Plato sometimes uses this complete
dialectical movement, and ends affirmatively;
sometimes he uses only the partial
movement and draws negative conclusions.</p>

<p class='c006'>How much better M. Janet’s book might
have been—we may be allowed to remark
in conclusion—had he possessed the earnest
spirit of such men as Vera and Hutchison
Stirling! Stimulated by its title,
we had hoped to find a book that would
kindle a zeal for the study of the profoundest
philosophical subject, as treated by the
profoundest of thinkers.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class='sc'>Note.</span> The same mistaking of one series of thinking in transcendental idealism for the
other series, lies at the basis of the assertion, that besides the system of idealism, another
realistic system is also possible as a logical and thorough system. The realism, which
forces itself upon all, even the most decided idealist, namely, the assumption that things exist
independently and outside of us, is involved in the idealistic system itself; and is moreover explained
and deduced in that system. Indeed, the deduction of an objective truth, as well in the
world of appearances as in the world of intellect, is the only purpose of all philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is the philosopher who says in <i>his own</i> name: everything that is <i>for</i> the Ego is also <i>through</i>
the Ego. But the Ego itself, in that philosopher’s philosophy says: as sure as I am I, there exists
outside of me a something, which exists <i>not</i> through me. The philosopher’s idealistic assertion
is therefore met by the realistic assertion of the Ego in the same one system; and it is the
philosopher’s business to show from the fundamental principle of his philosophy how the Ego
comes to make such an assertion. The philosopher’s stand-point is the purely speculative; the
Ego’s stand-point in his system is the realistic stand-point of life and science; the philosopher’s
system is Science of Knowledge, whilst the Ego’s system is common Science. But common
Science is comprehensible only through the Science of Knowledge, the realistic system comprehensible
only through the idealistic system. Realism forces itself upon us; but it has in
itself no known and comprehensible ground. Idealism furnishes this ground, and is only to
make realism comprehensible. Speculation has no other purpose than to furnish this comprehensibility
of all reality, which in itself would otherwise remain incomprehensible. Hence, also,
Idealism can never be a mode of thinking, but can only be <i>speculation</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One cannot but be astonished not to see,
in this review of the principal forms of oriental
art, Chinese art at least mentioned. The
reason is, that, according to Hegel, art—the
fine arts, properly speaking—have no existence
among the Chinese. The spirit of that
people seems to him anti-artistic and prosaic.
He thus characterizes Chinese art in his philosophy
of history: “This race, in general,
has a rare talent for imitation, which is exercised
not only in the things of daily life, but
also in art. It has not yet arrived at the representation
of the beautiful as beautiful. In
painting, it lacks perspective and shading.
European images, like everything else, it copies
well. A Chinese painter knows exactly
how many scales there are on the back of a
carp, how many notches a leaf has; he knows
perfectly the form of trees and the curvature
of their branches; but the sublime, the ideal,
and the beautiful, do not belong at all to the
domain of his art and his ability.”—(<i>Philosophie
der Geschichte.</i>)</p>

these categories, <i>although I may be in possession

each by its determined relation to the possibility
of self consciousness, and whoever is in
possession of these definitions, is necessarily
possessed of the Science of Knowledge. Again,
p. 109: “<i>In a system of pure reason</i> this definition
might justly be required of me, but in the
present work they would only obscure the
main point.” Here he clearly opposes two

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here is the corner stone of Kant’s realism.
I <i>must think</i> something as thing in itself, i. e.
as independent of <i>me, the empirical</i>, whenever
I occupy the standpoint of the empirical; and
because I <i>must think</i> so, I never become conscious
of this activity in my thinking, <i>since it
is not free</i>. Only when I occupy the standpoint

that I am active in this thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To state the main point in a few words:
<i>All being</i> signifies a <i>limitation of free activity</i>.
Now this activity is regarded <i>either</i> as that of
the mere intelligence, and then that which is
posited as limiting this activity has a mere
<i>ideal being, mere objectivity in regard to consciousness</i>.—This
objectivity is in every representation
(even in that of the Ego, of virtue, of the
moral law, &amp;c., or in that of complete phantasms,
as, for instance, a squared circle, a
sphynx, &amp;c.) <i>object of the mere representation</i>.
Or the free activity is regarded as <i>having actual
causality</i>; and then that which limits it, has
<i>actual</i> existence, the <i>real world</i>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have repeated this frequently. I have

they are not, and cannot be, where I am. This
seems to have been taken rather for an hyperbole,
uttered in indignation, than for real earnest;
for they do not cease to repeat their demand:
“Prove <i>to us</i> thy doctrine!” I must
solemnly assure them that I was perfectly
serious in that statement, that it is my deliberate
and decided conviction. Dogmatism
proceeds from a <i>being</i> as the Absolute, and
hence its system never rises above being.
Idealism knows no being, as something for
itself existing. In other words: Dogmatism
proceeds from necessity—Idealism from freedom.
They are, therefore, in two utterly different
worlds.</p>

and mystifies him as completely as ever the

elated by the discovery of this remarkable
precocity in my son—a precocity which, at
the age of three years, (!) shows him possessed
of all the incapacity of such “learned

utter want of appreciation which the little fellow
showed of this, his exalted condition!</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From this a variety of facts in the character
and history of the different works of art
become apparent. The degree of the effect
produced, for example, is owing to the degree
of validity attached to the two sides of the contradiction.
If the duties which the individual
owes to the family and the state come into
conflict, as in the Antigone of Sophocles, and
the consciousness of the age has not subordinated
the ideas upon which they are based,
but accords to each an equal degree of validity,
we have a content replete with the noblest
effects. For this is not a conflict between the
abstract good and bad, the positive and the
negative, but a conflict within the good itself.
So likewise the universality of the effect is
apparent from the content. If this is the self-consciousness
of a nation, the work of art will
be national. To illustrate this, and, at the
same time, to trace the development of the particularity
spoken of into a collision, we may
refer to that great national work of art—the
Iliad of Homer. The particularity which distinguishes
the national self-consciousness of
the Greeks is the preëminent validity attached
by it to one of the before-mentioned modes of
the actualization of self-conscious intelligence—the
sensuous. Hence its worship of the
Beautiful. This preëminence and the consequent
subordination of the moral and the rational
modes to it, is the root of the contradiction,
and hence the basis of the collision
which forms the content of the poem. Its
motive modernized would read about as follows:
“The son of one of our Senators goes

<p class='c006'>But—now mark—adverse winds ensue,
powers not human are in arms against them,
and before these can be propitiated, a princess
of the blood royal, pure and undefiled, must
be sacrificed!—is sacrificed, and for what?
That all Greece may proclaim to the world
that pure womanhood, pure manhood, family,
society, and the state, are nothing, must be
sacrificed on the altar of the Beautiful. For
in the sacrifice of Iphigenia, all that could
perish in Helen, and more too—for Iphigenia
was pure and Helen was not—was offered up
by the Greeks, woman for woman, and nothing
remained but the Beautiful, for which she
henceforth became the expression. For in
this alone did Helen excel Iphigenia, and all
women.</p>

<p class='c006'>But how is this? Have not the filial, the
parental, the social, the civil relations, sanctity
and validity? Not as against the realization
of the Beautiful, says the Greek. Nor yet the
state? No; “I do not go at the command of
Agamemnon, but because I pledged fealty to
Beauty.” “But then,” Sir Achilles, “if the
Beautiful should present itself under some individual
form—say that of Briseis—you would
for the sake of its possession disobey the will
of the state?” “Of course.” And the poet
has to sing, “Achilles’ wrath!” and not “the
recovery of the runaway wife,” the grand historical
action.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r25'>25</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first postulate of natural science is an
antithesis in the pure identity of Nature. This
antithesis must be thought quite purely, and
not with any other substrate besides that of
activity; for it is the condition of all substrate.

without a substrate, cannot philosophize

entirely cancel itself in <i>B</i>, and is therefore carried
over to <i>C</i>. The antithesis in <i>C</i> is therefore
maintained by <i>B</i>, but only in so far as <i>A</i>
maintains the antithesis which is the condition
of <i>B</i>.</p>

only relatively cancelled.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r30'>30</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The struggle towards indifference attains
the preponderance over the antithesis, at a
greater or less distance from the body which
exercises the distribution, (as, for example, at
a certain distance, the action by distribution,
which an electric or magnetic body exercises
upon another body, appears as cancelled.) The
difference in this distance is the ground of the
difference of world-bodies in one and the same
system, inasmuch, namely, as one part of the
matter is subjected to indifference more than
the rest. Since, therefore, the condition of all
product is difference, difference must again
arise at every step as the source of all existence,
but must also be thought as again cancelled.
By this continual reproduction and
resuscitation creation takes place anew at every
step.</p>

strives to revert, and to which it
would revert, if the antithesis were ever cancelled.
Let us suppose the original condition
of Nature = 0 (want of reality). Now zero can
certainly be thought as dividing itself into 1 - 1
(for this = 0); but if we posit that this division
as not infinite (as it is in the infinite series
1 - 1 + 1 - 1 ...), then Nature will as it were
oscillate continually between zero and unity—and
this is precisely its condition.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f46'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r46'>46</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We have therefore the following scheme
of the dynamical process:</p>

<p class='c006'>First stage: Unity of the product—magnetism.</p>

<p class='c006'>Second stage: Duplicity of the products—electricity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Third stage: Unity of the products—chemical
process.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f47'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r47'>47</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The conclusions which may be deduced
from this construction of dynamical phenomena
are partly anticipated in what goes
before. The following may serve for further
explanation:</p>

<p class='c006'>The chemical process, for example, in its
highest perfection is a process of combustion.
Now I have already shown on another occasion,
that the condition of light in the body
undergoing combustion is nothing else but the
maximum of its positive electrical condition.
For it is always the positively electrical condition
that is also the combustible. Might not,
then, this coexistence of the phenomenon of
light with the chemical process in its highest
perfection give us information about the
ground of every phenomenon of light in Nature?</p>

<p class='c006'>What happens, then, in the chemical process?
Two whole products gravitate towards each
other. The <i>indifference</i> of the <i>individual</i> is
therefore <i>absolutely</i> cancelled. This absolute
cancelling of indifference puts the whole body
into the condition of light, just as the partial in
the electric process puts it into a partial condition
of light. Therefore, also the light—what
seems to stream to us from the sun—is nothing
else but the phenomenon of indifference
cancelled at every step. For as gravity never
ceases to act, its condition—antithesis—must
be regarded as springing up again at every
step. We should thus have in light a continual,
visible appearing of gravitation, and it
would be explained why, in the system of
worlds, it is exactly those bodies which are
the principal seat of gravity that are also the
principal source of light. We should then,
also, have an explanation of the connection in
which the action of light stands to that of
gravitation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The manifold effects of light on the deviations
of the magnetic needle, on atmospheric
electricity, and on organic nature, would be
explained by the very fact that light is the
phenomenon of indifference continually cancelled—therefore,
the phenomenon of the dynamical
process continually rekindled. It is,
therefore, one antithesis that prevails in all
dynamical phenomena—in those of magnetism,
electricity and light; for example, the antithesis,
which is the condition of the electrical phenomena
must already enter into the first construction
of matter. For all bodies are certainly
electrical.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f48'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r48'>48</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or rather, conversely, the more combustible
is always also the positively electric;
whence it is manifest that the body which
burns has merely reached the maximum of +
electricity.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r49'>49</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And indeed it is so. What then is the
absolute incombustible? Doubtless, simply
that wherewith everything else burns—oxygen.
But it is precisely this absolutely incombustible
oxygen that is the principle of negative electricity,
and thus we have a confirmation of
what I have already stated in the Ideas for a
Philosophy of Nature, viz. that oxygen is a
principle of a negative kind, and therefore the
representative, as it were, of the power of
attraction; whereas phlogiston, or, what is the
same thing, positive electricity, is the representative
of the positive, or of the force of repulsion.
There has long been a theory that
the magnetic, electric, chemical, and, finally,
even the organic phenomena, are interwoven
into one great interdependent whole. This
must be established. It is certain that the
connection of electricity with the process of
combustion may be shown by numerous experiments.
One of the most recent of these
that has come to my knowledge I will cite.
It occurs in Scherer’s <i>Journal of Chemistry</i>. If
a Leyden jar is filled with iron filings, and repeatedly
charged and discharged, and if, after
the lapse of some time, this iron is taken out
and placed upon an isolator—paper, for example—it
begins to get hot, becomes incandescent,
and changes into an oxide of iron. This
experiment deserves to be frequently repeated
and more closely examined—it might readily
lead to something new.</p>

<p class='c006'>This great interdependence, which a scientific
system of physics must establish, extends over
the whole of Nature. It must, therefore, once
established, spread a new light over the History
of the whole of Nature. Thus, for example, it
is certain that all geology must start from terrestrial
magnetism. But terrestrial electricity
must again be determined by magnetism.
The connection of North and South with
magnetism is shown even by the irregular
movements of the magnetic needle. But
again, with universal electricity, which, no
less than gravity and magnetism, has its indifference
point—the universal process of combustion
and all volcanic phenomena stand connected.</p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore, it is certain that there is one
chain going from universal magnetism down
to the volcanic phenomena. Still these are all
only scattered experiments.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to make this interdependence <i>fully</i>
evident, we need the central phenomenon, or
central experiment, of which Bacon speaks
oracularly—(I mean the experiment wherein
all those functions of matter, magnetism, electricity,
&amp;c., so run together in one phenomenon
that the <i>individual</i> function is distinguishable)—proving
that the one does not lose itself
immediately in the other, but that each can
be exhibited separately—an experiment which,
when it is discovered, will stand in the same relation
to the <i>whole</i> of Nature, as galvanism does
to organic nature. [Compare this with the discourse
on Faraday’s latest discovery, (1832,)

that matter is primarily constructed.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r51'>51</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the already mentioned discourse on
Faraday’s latest discovery, the author cites
the passage (p. 75, original edition,) as well as
§ 56 sq. of the <i>General View of the Dynamical
Process</i> (likewise written <i>before</i> the invention
of the voltaic pile,) as a proof of his having
<i>anticipated</i> the discoveries which proved the
<i>unity</i> of the electrical and the chemical antithesis,
and of the similar connection subsisting
between magnetic and chemical phenomena.

<div class='footnote' id='f52'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r52'>52</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Every individual is an expression of the
whole of Nature. As the existence of the
<i>single</i> organic individual rests on that scale, so
does the whole of Nature. Organic nature
maintains the whole wealth and variety of
her products only by continually changing
the relation of those three functions.—In like
manner inorganic Nature brings forth the
whole wealth of her product, only by changing
the relation of those three functions of
matter <i>ad infinitum</i>; for magnetism, electricity,
and chemical process are the functions of
matter generally, and on that ground alone
are they categories for the construction of all
matter. This fact, that those three factors
are not phenomena of special kinds of matter,
but <i>functions of all matter</i> universally, gives its
real, and its innermost sense to dynamical
physics, which, by this circumstance alone,
rises far above all other kinds of physics.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r53'>53</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That is, the organic product can be

the Outlines, p. 163.—What the dynamical
action is, which according to the Outlines is
also the cause of irritability, is now surely
clear enough. It is the <i>universal action</i> which
is everywhere conditioned by the cancelment
of indifference, and which at last tends towards
intussusception (indifference of products)
when it is not continually prevented, as
it is in the process of irritation. (<i>Remark of

In the first construction of our earth, what

otherwise than under the condition of opposite
powers? Compare an utterance of Kant
on this subject, in his Anthropology. (<i>Remark

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r58'>58</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the product, indifference of the first and
second powers is arrived at (for example, by
irritation itself an origin of <i>mass</i> [i. e. indifference
of the first order] and even <i>chemical
products</i> [i. e. indifference of the second order]
are reached), but indifference of the third
power can never be reached, because it is a
contradictory idea. (<i>Remark of the original.</i>)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f59'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r59'>59</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The product is productive only from the
fact of its being a product of the third power.
But the idea of a productive product is itself
a contradiction. What is productivity is not
product, and what is product is not productivity.
Therefore a product of the third power
is itself a contradictory idea. From this even
is manifest what an extremely artificial condition
life is—wrenched, as it were, from Nature—subsisting
against her will.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r60'>60</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nothing shows more clearly the contradictions
out of which life arises, and the fact
that it is altogether only a heightened condition
of <i>ordinary</i> natural forces, than the contradiction
of Nature in what she tries, but
tries in vain, to reach through the <i>sexes</i>.—Nature
<i>hates</i> sex, and where it does arise, it
arises against her will. The diremption into
sexes is an inevitable fate, with which, after
she is once organic, she must put up, and
which she can never overcome.—By this very
hatred of diremption she finds herself involved
in a contradiction, inasmuch as what
is odious to her she is compelled to develop in
the most careful manner, and to lead to the
summit of existence, as if she did it on purpose;
whereas she is always striving only for
a return into the identity of the genus, which,
however, is chained to the (never to be cancelled)
duplicity of the sexes, as to an inevitable
condition. That she develops the
individual only from compulsion, and for the
sake of the genus, is manifest from this, that
wherever in a genus she <i>seems</i> desirous of
maintaining the individual longer (though this
is never really the case), she finds the genus
becoming more uncertain, because she must
hold the sexes farther asunder, and, as it
were, make them flee from each other. In
this region of Nature, the decay of the individual
is not so visibly rapid as it is where the
sexes are nearer to each other, as in the case
of the rapidly withering flower, in which, from
its very birth, they are enclosed in a calix as
in a bride-bed, but in which, for that very
cause, the <i>genus</i> is better <i>secured</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nature is the <i>laziest of animals</i>, and curses
diremption, because it imposes upon her the
necessity of activity; she is active only in
order to rid herself of this necessity. The
opposites must for ever shun, in order for ever
to seek, each other; and for ever seek, in order
never to find, each other; it is only in <i>this</i>
contradiction that the ground of all the activity
of Nature lies. (<i>Remark of the original.</i>)</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r64'>64</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The word “Idea” does not have the sense
here given it, except in Hegel, and in a very
few translations of him. For the most part the
word is used, (e. g. in Schelling’s Philosophy
of Nature in this number,) as a translation for
the German “<i>Begriff</i>,” which we call “<i>comprehension</i>,”
adopting the term in this sense from
the author of the “Letters on Faust.” It will
do no harm to use so expressive a word as
comprehension in an objective sense as well
as in a subjective one. The thought itself is
<i>bizarre</i>, and not merely the word; it is useless
to expect to find words that are used commonly
in a speculative sense. One must seek
a word that has several meanings, and grasp
these meanings all together in one, to have
the speculative use of a word. Spirit has
formed words for speculative ideas by the
deepest of instincts, and these words have been
unavoidably split up into different meanings
by the sensuous thinking, which always loses
the connecting links.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
